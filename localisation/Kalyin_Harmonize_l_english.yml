    kalyin_harmonize.50.d:0 "All gods, goddesses and deities are different aspects of the one true Goddess, Kalyin. Proponents of the One Truth in our country have urged the importance of ensuring that we understand how Kalyin is portrayed in other cultures to further our understanding an own beliefs. We have explored the beliefs that the [harmonized_target.Religion.GetGroupName] people hold, and their interpretations of divinity and faith. After years of work, our administrators have been able to integrate a part of the [harmonized_target.Religion.GetGroupName] customs and faith into our worship of Kalyin. This also allows the followers of [harmonized_target.Religion.GetGroupName] their own unique worship of Kalyin to stay intact."
