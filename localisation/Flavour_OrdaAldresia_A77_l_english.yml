 flavor_orda_aldresia.1.d:0 "The Orda Aldresia (meaning Aldresian Order) was founded after the Aldresian Crusade, when the knight Aldresia led valiant warriors against the undead hordes of the White Pestilience, driving the crusade into the heart of Corvuria and defeating the lich and former acolyte of the Sorcerer-King, Cancrec the Defiler. Since then the Orda Aldresia has safeguarded Cannor from undead and other evil threats using the highly secretive art of Diranbe, bladedancing: the ability to cast spells with a blade as if it were a wand.\n\nThe Order was also instrumental in helping found the Empire of Anbennar in 1221, and eventually turned into the personal bodyguards of the emperor, who they saw as the embodiment of justice and fairness in Cannor.\n\nObviously that has not always been the case, and the order stagnated from chivalrous knights saving all of Cannor to token bodyguards for decadent emperors... until now.\n\nThe High Rectorate has made Aldresia the first ever non-deity saint in the Ravelian Church, and the order has shifted its focus as vanguards of the Ravelian faith."

 flavor_orda_aldresia.2.d:0 "When the 4th Lilac War began, we held to our oaths, raising our blades and banners for the one true Emperor: Grand Duke Adenn Skylance. Kind, charismatic, and chivalrous, the Grand Duke of Dameria had little trouble convincing us to follow him into battle.\n\nFor two decades, we fought for him without question. Had he ordered us into the hells, we would've followed him with a smile. Some would call it fanaticism or zeal, but any knight worth their salt would've seen it for what it was: true belief in a dream of a safe and peaceful Anbennar. Yet no matter our resolve, no matter our oaths, we failed a great man.\n\nWhen now-Emperor Lothane assaulted the Imperial Palace at the end of the Lilac Wars, and killed then-Emperor Adénn Skylance, there was widespread denial amongst our order. For a full year, we withstood his overtures at attempting a peace. The Wexonard had sense to not approach Arca Aldresia, as we would sacrifice our entire order to cut through his army and take his head.\n\nBut, with time, there has been discontent growing within Aldresia; a question of our purpose, with some even claiming we've betrayed our oaths. Few are friends of Lothane, but we are Sentinels of the Empire, and Anbennar is more than just one man. \n\nLothane has sent a final messenger to us, asking for our return without conditions. We must uphold our duties once again, but will our order survive it?"

The vote was all but certain, Prince Adenn Skylance, Duke of Dameria, would ascend and usher in a golden age for the Empire. However the midnight before the elections, on the 5th of Bloomsdawn, 1422,  Lothane sil Wex, Duke of Wex, attempted to assassinate Prince Adenn Skylance kicking off the Fifth Lilac War. In the weeks after as allegiances were declared and skirmishes commenced, Skylance arrived at our order’s ancestral home, Arca Aldresia and sought our aid. \n\nGrandmaster Delian sil Arrannen, childhood friend of Prince Adenn was zealous in his support for Adenn and declared Orda for the Moon Party much to the rancor of those wanting to stay neutral. In 1424, those dissidents abandoned our cause to fight the raging Greentide to the north nearly sending us to collapse but the leadership of Delian preserved our order. We fought valiantly, we fought fanatically, but we failed and in 1443 Adenn Skylance was slain by Lothane sil Wex.\n\nWe held out for a year, until summer of 1444 being the last members of the Moon Party to surrender. We expected to fight till our last breath as the Rose Party armies mounted outside Arca Aldresia’s siege. But in the end, Grandmaster Delian surrendered, humiliating and infuriating our order who bent the knee to the usurper. \n\nWe now barely stand, a ghost of our former glory. Half of our order had left to fight the Greentide, the other half were slaughtered in the Lilac War, we serve an Emperor who usurped the rightful heir of the Empire, and Grandmaster Delian has all but abdicated his responsibilities in leading us. Our order is in a crisis, time will tell if we will survive."

An Aldresian Knight, middle aged yet with no more insignia than a recruit on his scarred armor answers the challenge with a blade drawn drawing shouts and murmurs. \n\nThe senior Aldresian Knight who flung the insult steps forward with her own blade drawn, fully gray hair in a pony tail and wearing a battle worn commander’s plate armor. Both pushing forward and meeting each other, their blades inches away from each other’s throats as they howl obscenities. Each accusing the other of betraying their oaths, of failing to protect the Emperor or failing to protect the innocent. \n\nThe Entire Orda watches as Grandmaster Delian arrives in a rare appearance, lucid from his usual absent demeanor as he marshals order back to the knights. Both prideful warriors return to their factions as the Grandmaster departs, leaving the Aldresian Senior Council to bridge the growing schism.\n\nFor decades we have fought a war outside the walls of Arca Aldresia and now we fight a war within. Younger battle hardened knights bristle at their status in the face of the older aging leadership. Called The Greentide Generation, they wish to make Orda Aldresia an effective fighting force but the resistance of elder knights are proving difficult to them. What will we do?"

Ever since he learned of Prince Adenn Skylance’s death.\n\n‘Dozing off on duty are you?’ Came an annoying voice.\n\nCrovan of Vinrick, Grand Magister of the ‘neutral’ Magisterium strode across the empty throne room with a punchable smile. Delian tried to ignore him. Emperor Lothane had declared an afternoon recess but Aldresians Knights never rested. \n\n‘I guess you’ve earned it in a way. You did join the winning side…at the end.’ Crovan winks, calling forth a spark of anger in Delian and for the first time in while, a whisper from his blade.\n\n‘But I mean, you did still support a feckless loser for a while, a false Emperor by the name of…Brokenlance was it?” The Grand Magister continued. \n\nThe whispering blade started to rouse, growing desperate, hectic, shouting internally.\n\n‘Ah well, we’re allies now aren't we? No harm…no foul.” Crovan laughed, turning around as Delian’s blade screamed in its hilt. \n\nDelian lightly touched the pommel of his blade as Crovan stopped. A daring brow raised from the Magister as the Grandmaster breathed deeply. Delian’s blade, Bloodbrother, howled for a bloody duet that the Grandmaster never joined.\n\n‘Thought not.’ Crovan cackled as the Grand Magister left leaving Delian alone in the throne room."

All the city from peasants to noble alike had come out to see the bustling and loud clanking of the proud second sons of the Empire march in perfect formation through the main street. Delian sat atop a horse, wearing the battle scarred armor he donned during the Lilac Wars and looked like a maiden’s fantasy come to life.\n\nThe Grandmaster had sent a larger regiment to the Emperor’s capital for more practical protection but the Anbenncost garrison would be crucial in securing the Aldresian’s prestige and status in the Empire. The first challenge in this would be securing Emperor Lothane’s trust, if he didn't plan any treachery against the order who nearly went extinct opposing him.\n\nDelian’s entourage found the gray-haired Emperor stood atop the palace’s steps, arms crossed with vicious eyes staring down at them.  Delian had grown up in the Imperial Palace, running and playing with Adenn as boys. But Adenn was dead, and his home lost to a Usurper who didn’t deserve any of his brother’s blades.\n\nAscending the steps, his locked to the Emperor’s, a murmur spread throughout the crowd before a scream. Emperor Lothane’s stone face turned to that of war as he drew a blade and Delian turned toward the commotion. A quarter of his retinue had drawn their sabers and bounded up the steps shouting a clear and desperate plea.\n\n‘Down with the Usurper!’ \n\nDelian’s hand reached for his blade as the rest of the order awaited his action. With a moment’s hesitation, he drew his blade and stepped down toward his treacherous brothers."

The Grandmaster stared at himself in the mirror, black hard eyes, salt and pepper hair, with a growing five o’clock shadow.  He was handsome once, when he was barely eighteen summers and the object of affection for a lovely Esmari young noblewoman he spent many nights with. A child was born of that tryst, a daughter that had been lost to time.\n\nWere it not for Adénn vouching for him to be inducted into the Orda Aldresia, he would not have escaped punishment from the brutal Esmari lord. Ironically, it was Adénn who introduced him to her. All he had, he owed to Prince Adénn. An Emperor, no- a brother…that he failed. And now he was to serve the Usurper, a tyrant by all measure who ravaged Anbenncost with unthinkable atrocity. \n\nCould he really do this? He was the last Moon Party war combatant to surrender, and his entire order nearly revolted against him when he threw open Arca Aldresia’s doors for Lothane.  He fought to the eleventh hour and in the end, was it all for not? But then again how could he have not surrendered? Only a hundred of the garrison remained, young and scared second sons who were high off of bravery, eighteen year olds as he was, who did not deserve death. \n\nAs he tapped the pommel of hid blade, blood brother, he stared toward the mahogany door in front of him. \n\nNo, he can’t give up. He can’t let the dream of Anbennar, the dream that Prince Adenn spoke of die like this. Not to a brutal tyrant, or from his own ambivalence. He had to rebuild his order, keep the peace, seek to somehow sideline this usurper and find Adenn’s son, Prince Rogier now the true Emperor of Anbennar missing somewhere in Escann. He had to fight… he had to fight!

He hadn’t been lucid like this in a while, not due to magic or any medicine but of his own internal struggles. The aging Grandmaster stood up as he stared at the neatly creased letter in his hands. He had to get this letter sent, no matter how small the possibility of success this could be.\n\nA crash outside sent his hand snapping to his sword as he swiveled forward. What was that? A servant? An assassin? With a breath, Delian rushed out with blade in hand as he came across a knight scrambling against the wall with a dagger in hand.\n\nThe Grandmaster looked up and down the fledgling knight. He was young, a pendant of the Silmuna’s around his necklace. The man’s name was Valan, he held Delian in contempt for letting Adenn die. He wasn’t wrong to feel that way. Before Delian could call for guards, he heard light footsteps behind him.\n\nThree shadows emerged from the darkness with blades drawn. Delian could see their faces in the moonlit castle hallway. They were young, the few who wished to die to Lothane than surrender to him, but most of all they were scared. And they outnumbered him. \n\n‘Grand-Grandmaster, for betraying the rightful Emperor Adenn Skylance, you are sen-sentenced to death!” One squire it appeared choked out. \n\nDelian exhaled, looking unblinking into the frightened eyes of these assassins.\n\nThey tried to speak, but his voice silenced them. ‘I am a second son who failed my brother, my order, and my Empire. Nothing you could say I haven’t told myself a thousand times over!’ The Grandmaster roared defiantly drawing his blade."

One was to recite their oath once again, renewing it to affirm their commitment to the values of Aldresia. For most Grandmasters this would have been a formality, but for Castana sil Hardwick, this was an argument for her reign. \n\nWith the passing of the controversial Grandmaster Delian sil Arannen, followed by multiple and notable short reigned Grandmasters, the Emperor personally picked Castana sil Hardwick against the wishes of the Order to serve as leader. She seemed like a respectable choice, she had been in the order for a decade now, arriving to join at the age of seventeen after escaping her arranged marriage at seventeen. However she hailed from Wex where many Aldresians still bear a grudge for the death of Adenn Skylance. \n\nAs Castana finishes her oath, she stands up and turns to the gathered knights before her.

The Grand Magister sent sternly worded letters to us and begged at the imperial court to intervene but we’ve undercut them in all manners of diplomacy. \n\nThe Magisterium gathered their own war mages, ready for the confrontation but we stepped passed across the border and found no fight. We are not sure if we’d be successful in taking the tower, but we’d die trying to and the mages understood our fervor. They teleported out as he reached the top of the tower, raising our own flag and cutting down theirs.\n\nOf concern however, as we delved into Old Tower’s archives and confiscated many of the Magisterium’s curious artifacts was a revelation that shocked us. Half burned letters sent to many Magisterium court mages of Imperial Electors and even minor princes, detailing a plan to usurp their rule! An outrageous plan but an even more outrageous claim! We must investigate, gather more proof of this treason, we are in a fight for not just our own order but for all of Anbennar. We cannot fail. "

More Aldresian patrols nearby arrived on scene as a full battle broke out. Magical steel clashed against fangs and superhuman strength.\n\nDozens of Aldresian Knights fell but hundreds more of this inhumane horde shattered against their resolve. Three of these beasts remained, less feral and appeared to be self preserving. The captain and her great host chased the three into the forest, cornering one who resorted to an all out assault. More powerful than the horde, it slew half of the retinue before finally being felled by a lone squire who stabbed it through the heart with a wooden stake felling the fiend.\n\nThe survivors recounted the battle as best they could to our shocked order.

The first challenge that met them was a moving maze holding living chests and shifting hounds out for blood. The second was a large cauldron demanding only the worthy to drink from it, the irony being one had to swim into the poisonous liquid and pull a lever unlocking a shut gate. And lastly, the most chilling was the hordes of silent undead waiting almost obediently for any intruder to approach.\n\nHells they were dabbling in necromancy! What else were these duplicitous and ruthless mages planning? Madalena exhaled as she slowly and cautiously stepped forward into this final chamber. Piles of gold caught her eyes but a second daughter of Verne was no stranger to wealth. She approached the middle of the chamber as the small chest hanging from a chain at the top nearly made her heart skip a beat.\n\nShe….she had only read about this in her books. Was….was that a…phylactery? The blood drained from her tanned skin as a pit formed in her stomach. The Grand Magister wished to usurp the Emperor, and was now seeking immortality in lichdom? How could she not believe it? The proof was right there!\n\nMadalena’s eyes wandered over to the rest of the room.

We had matured into efficient hunters.\n\nThe ‘battle’ lasted barely a minute as Conric and his knights blinded the vampire and drove a stake through its heart, paralyzing it. In our interrogation, we learned an alarming amount of information of vampirekind. Vampires organized into complex clans, had special bonds between a ‘sire’ and a ‘sireling’, and were more than just the feral beasts we thought of. They fought amongst each other, significantly intelligent, but above all had an innate need to hunt else they’d turn bloodcrazy.\n\nAllegedly, an organization of vampires had grouped together, the first of its kind in Corvuria. The vampire originated from there, but was banished for opposing the will of a powerful clan who had recently taken a more aggressive posture. We believe this specific clan may be the one causing all these murders and kidnappings.

Besides, we're only enforcing the letter of the tax law."

A well balanced blade equipped with a flintlock, these innovative minds claim we can both engage in our ancient Diranbe, cold hard steel, and the furious firepower of shot all at the same time.
