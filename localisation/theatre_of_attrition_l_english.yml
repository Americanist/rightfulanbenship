 theatre_of_attrition.1.desc: "[Root.KoboldTrapsDynamicText]\n\nOur nation’s ideas for traps are endless, but our capacity to implement them is limited. Thankfully, we have diverted the required resources to either creating a new trap, upgrading an existing one, or simply training our trappers. Where shall we build our next trap?"

## Dynamic Loc Options
 kobold_quote_1: ""You take the flamefungi spores and grow them in the walls. You set up a tripwire, which pulls at the lever... and it swings down, provoking the fungi. Their defense mechanism: flame! Like the name! It’s as easy as that." – Trapmaster Fegru"
 kobold_quote_2: ""Arrange a single party of kobolds as bait. Ensure they are smaller, quicker, and worse-armed than their comrades. Wait until they have been spotted, at which point they shall duck, hide, and run away from the attackers. They shall lead them directly into the clearing in the woods, at which point they will duck into the pre-dug burrow. Then, the surrounding kobolds shall fire cannons into the pursuing army, ensuring that none survive." – Tactician Tikray"
 kobold_quote_3: ""Drakes are holy creatures. They are our kin, for they too are children of dragons; and though they have not our cunning, they have the strength of ten kobolds combined. As they have protected us in the past, they protect us today! Do we not honor them by unleashing them upon our foes, by dangling meat above their heads, by allowing them the delectable feast of the adventurer? Do we not allow them the true experience of draconic glory by allowing them to fight with delight? Is it not our obligation to train them for the traps, and to weaponize them against our foes?" – Dragon-priest Snepi" 
 kobold_quote_4: ""Bugs! Cover them with bugs! Humans hate bugs!" – Trapidary Rudri" 
 kobold_quote_5: ""At the end of the corridor, there is a pressure plate. DO NOT STAND ON THE PRESSURE PLATE. IF YOU STEP ON THE PRESSURE PLATE, THE BOMB EXPLODES. YOU WILL DIE. IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF MONEY TO REPLACE THE TRAP. AGAIN: DO NOT STAND ON THE PRESSURE PLATE.\n\nAs of the time of writing, it has been three days since the last kobold stepped on the pressure plate." – Instructions for Operating the Moorgaru Traps, 1476"
 kobold_quote_6: ""The easiest breach within the structure of the traps is at the point marked with an ‘X’ on this map. Do not falter when the breach occurs; it is part of the design. The enemy will believe themselves victorious, and shall rush through the breach... right into an interior wall, coated entirely in crossbows aimed right at them. They shall not make it out alive." – Trappist Uho" 
 kobold_quote_7: ""Bats are useful creatures. They help spread the spores of our favorite fungi, and they eat plenty of pests which could ruin our crops! Interestingly, it turns out that they also are host to a multitude of diseases which affect humans, but not kobolds. Therefore, I highly recommend keeping bats as pets within cavern-traps. Not only will the garrison be fed with plentiful, well-maintained fungi, but any besieging attackers might fall victim to the bat-plagues!" – Leiutrappant Vitru" 
 kobold_quote_8: ""Ensure that as much of the trap as possible is underground; ensure that all ‘loot,’ whether in the form of hoard-gold or in martial supplies, is kept at the bottom layer. Ensure, too, that the gunpowder is kept in these depths. If the enemy penetrates every layer of defenses, and manages to push into the supply depot... well, with a well-timed explosion, you won’t make it out, but they won’t make it out, either. And neither will the gold." – Trapdasher Kovu" 
 kobold_quote_9: ""The blood of the dragon flows through our veins! The dragon’s inheritance warms us and keeps us safe through every frigid night. Some kobolds, and oh how we bless them, may harness this blood: the draconic sorcerers are few in rank, but their dragonfire breath awes our enemies entire. These sorcerers are tools not only of morale, but also of incredible firepower. Keep an alchemist on-hand at all times to brew potions which may increase the potency of the dragon-breath, and your traps will always be safe!" – Dragon-priest Drighad" 
 kobold_quote_10: ""They think height to be their advantage, but it is their downfall! Arrow-traps shall shoot at human chest level, and nothing valuable will be accessible by anyone greater than four feet in height. Send warm smoke to rise through the air, and let them choke on their own egos!" – Traptician Erkil" 
 kobold_quote_11: ""My greatest work? There was a sea-cliffside path on the southern road that was a full day faster than the pass road. We had stopped whole armies there before. A general from Lorent insisted on marching along that path, taking precious time to spot and clear every regular tripwire, inspect every bush. Cost him dozens of men for a clear road.\n\nAt one point a bridge on it crosses the gorge of the Koa River, two hundred feet below. They spent DAYS trying to find out how we'd rigged the bridge this time. Couldn't find anything. Eventually the general puffed up his big self and stormed across it on his horse. Nothing happened. He yelled at his whole army for ‘overestimating these lizards’ while riding ahead.\n\nHe was still yelling at them when his horse stepped on a spring plate fifty feet past the bridge. Every time I think of the look on his face, and the look on his army's face, when he was launched screaming into the sea, I can't stop laughing." – Trapidary Ris Sharpeye" 
 kobold_quote_12: ""Don't forget that simple traps sometimes are the most effective. Yes, they are less fancy than our more recent and elaborate traps, but a pitfall will kill a human just as reliably as a firebomb or an automated crossbow.\n\nNow, if you really want to trick a human, make them ‘miraculously’ overcome difficult traps, and when they get close to their goal, they'll expect another one, not a simple one. My favorite? Dropping a boulder on them. They literally never see it coming!" – Traptician Farol the Old" 
 kobold_quote_13: ""While a lot of people dismiss it, mud is one of the greatest traps nature made. It might look basic, but finding the right mix takes experience. Got to make sure the mud is thick enough for us kobolds to cross, while anything bigger, be it human or gnome machinery, will sink. Even if you can't get the pit deep enough to drown, you can always poke ‘em with spears to finish them off. Simple, cheap, efficient. And easy to scavenge their remains." – Trapmaster Metza" 
 kobold_quote_14: ""As the old saying goes, a lost human is a dead human. All you gotta do is lure ‘em through a cave where Wanderer's Bane grows: thanks to its spores, they'll become a li’l intoxicated, and– more importantly– lose all sense of direction. You'll have an easier time splitting their group, and making them meet their end." – Trapeteer Ristir" 
 kobold_quote_15: ""A cheap way to delay or stump adventurers is simply to sprinkle doors and levers everywhere. They don't have to do or lead to anything, because adventurers have been observed to stop and get into arguments when seeing even a hint of a button. It's a great method of stalling: all your troops can reposition, and your other traps can be released, all on the hapless adventures who can’t help themselves. Plus, you can also make it so that every eighth lever DOES activate another trap! They’ll bring the consequences upon themselves!" – Trapezist Glazna" 
 kobold_quote_16: ""Adventurers beware! One of the more creative, if not artistic, traps rarely employed by the kobolds is a makeshift dragon’s maw with a small pile of valuable goods inside. You may think this an altar to be looted at your leisure, but do not be fooled: the treasure inside is bait, ready to lure you in. If you pick up the idol or gem which is laid within the maw, a trigger will be activated, and the maw will fall down upon you! Do not become consumed by the dragon, whether hewn from scale or stone!" – Field Guide to Fighting Dragon Coast Kobolds, Thirteenth Edition" 
 kobold_quote_17: ""It's fine if some kobolds want to invite wayward humans into their trivu, let a thousand scales shine as far as I'm concerned. But I ain't spending any time on it, because in the meantime, every three months, a kobold is getting torn to pieces by drakes in unmaintained traps." – Politraptian Kob" 
 kobold_quote_18: ""As fatal as the things we devise may be, we have found that the surface world is crueler and more cunning than any kobold. Beneath the mountains and earth, there had been pools of water, and many kobolds are adept swimmers. Yet we were unprepared for the vastness of the sea, nor the strength of its pull. Many early pioneers who sought out the bounty of the waves found that the tide was a force not to be trifled with, and many a kobold was dragged out to sea and never seen again. Slowly, over time, we came to understand the nature of the hungry waves... and with understanding came the invention of Tidetraps.\n\nTidetraps are a relatively simple construction, a pit with a wooden hatch placed over it. However, the hatch is placed on a single hinge and the pits are dug into locations which are submerged at high tide. During high tide, the pit is safe to walk over, as the water helps support the hatch. However, at low tide, the hatch will come loose and drop the unfortunate victim into the pit. Should they remain in the pit until high tide, they will drown. This allows the trap to be only as lethal as necessary, with foolish kobolds who wander into it being easily rescued, and dangerous adventurers left to the mercy of the sea. Or lack thereof." – Trapseer Soxxus Greenscale" 
 kobold_quote_19: ""Gnomes- may Malliath forgive me for uttering their name- are more interested in reading and scavenging the ruins of their lost country than actually fighting. By lining tunnels with kobold writing and old gnomish literature, we slow down the advances of any invader, allowing for our counter attack to be better-organized and for their element of surprise to be lost. It doesn't matter if we write down children's tales or state secrets, the slowed-down gnomes won't have a chance to tell their hideous allies once we're done with them." – Dragon-priest Quetzal" 
 kobold_quote_20: ""Even when we learn their stupid language, no one ever listens to us! We tell them how great dragons are, they babble about their stupid gods. We tell them to stay off of our land, they blunder in with weapons! So, fine, let them not listen! By providing a well-marked safe path, we can ensure that any ‘clever’ fool will avoid it in favor of walking right into our traps. We call this tendency ‘Backwards think.’ And, of course, it doesn't hurt we sprinkle a few unmarked traps along the safe path, which only we know about." – Krr'Nax, designated Humanspeaker" 
 kobold_quote_21: ""Sometimes, my genius, it astounds me! The beauty in its simplicity, the sheer REUSABILITY! By utilizing the velocity of water diverted from nearby subterranean lakes or mountaintop runoff, channeled through a very long and winding tunnel, paired together with pitfalls dropping into this tunnel, anyone who DARES invade our tunnels will be forced through a high pressure cascade of rushing water, disorienting them from the all the twists and turns and drowning them the whole way. And if the water and turbulence doesn't get them, we'll be waiting right where it empties into a cistern, ready to dredge up their bodies for any loot!\n\nADDENDUM: Some of my colleagues have pointed out that perhaps such an idea could be used recreationally. PREPOSTEROUS! Such a design is too perfect to be used for such banal reasons!" – Burrowtect Saklu"
