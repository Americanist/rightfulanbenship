 G74_a_throne_for_the_queen_title: "A Throne for the Queen"
 G74_a_throne_for_the_queen_desc: "The ties between us and Darkalyndar have roots deep in the past: one of the first subject to join us, the last to leave us. But the past is the past, and the current rulers of the city can't be trusted to keep our nation on amicable terms. Harrihara X is determined to put his wife Azhera, a Darkalyndar's princess, on the throne - that, he believes, will ensure our nations' friendship.\nBut, some on the court ask, can she be trusted?"

 G74_tribes_chief_title: "The Tribes Chief"
 G74_tribes_chief_desc: "Darkalyndar already enjoy a fruitful relationship with the sarihaddi tribe that lives inside its borders; we should extend it to the other tribes to have our chendhyans allies be, at least nominally, masters of the desert."

 G74_two_nations_one_army_title: "Two Nations, One Army"
 G74_two_nations_one_army_desc: "Our empires have all been built on the back of our infantry, unparalleled on the continent. Cavalry was always an afterthought, a few skirmishers to chase the enemy after the day was already won.\nWe were blind. An elite cavalry opens up a myriad of new options on the battlefield.\nWe are still bad at this mounted business, but Darkalyndar is not. So, the utmost effort will be put in integrating deeply our two armies, to reach new pinnacles of military might!"

 G74_two_nations_one_territory_title: "Two Nations, One Territory"
 G74_two_nations_one_territory_desc: "Opening the borders with Darkalyndar wasn't part of a grand plan, just a question of opportunity and resources; while we expected some merchants to make use of that, what we didn't imagine was people migrating across the border, and the boon that would provide our kingdoms: knowledges are shared, previously empty territories get exploited, more wealth is produced. We shall now encourage and fund these movements, for it will start a golden era for both our realms."

 G74_two_people_one_nation_title: "Two People, One Nation"
 G74_two_people_one_nation_desc: "Our armies many limbs of a single body, our lands many fields for one melting pot of peoples, our king - one, for two thrones. Just the final step is missing to make our nations from two, one."

 G74_control_the_relics_title: "Control the Relics"
 G74_control_the_relics_desc: "Taychendi empires have been made and dismantled by powerful Relic-wielding Lords and as such, it's imperative that we keep a thight control on the places where most often Relics are found.\nClose to our borders, the deserts of Sarihaddu and Bukkana Varanya are filled to the brim with ancient artifacts: our men need to control what comes out of there.\nThe Green Desert could be said to already be ours, by virtue of our newly gained subject of Darkalyndar, but those chendhyans can't be trusted - a permanent yodhanpir garrison will have to be established there to interact with the local sarihaddi tribe without middlemen."

 G74_first_line_of_offence_title: "First Line of Offence"
 G74_first_line_of_offence_desc: "Darkalyndar is very proud of its army.\n"Elite chendhyans jaguar riders together with a professionalism on par with Gophira's Ironblood army!"\nVery well, let them flex it. They'll be the first to charge in our battles, our attack dogs."

 G74_war_economy_title: "War Economy"
 G74_war_economy_desc: "The Tydhzegaeda, Darkalyndar's jaguars, are smart, quick, strong and fearsome, but what they are not is cheap.\nStill, we intend to expand their number as much as possible, by focusing Darkalyndar economy on them.\nWe'll build the infrastructure - livestock ranches, catteries, training grounds - and the chendhyans will be the workers and riders.\nWe'll have the chendhyans herders and riders inside our border migrate there to work, and the rest, if they don't want to follow, will be encouraged to adopt our customs and become proper taychendi."

 G74_our_weapons_their_riders_title: "Our Weapons, Their Riders"
 G74_our_weapons_their_riders_desc: "With the improved forging capabilities, we have some spare weapons: these can be given to our refound friends in Darkalyndar and, in exchange, enlist some of their cavalry will fight for us.\nWho knows, in the future it could be more than a few units."

 G74_rekindle_the_forges_title: "Rekindle the Forges"
 G74_rekindle_the_forges_desc: "We're not Kattisangamar or Banderuttai, we don't waste days on a single shield or spear to claim perfection. What we pride ourselves on is the sheer amount of metalwork our forges produce.\nBut it's not enough, we need more, the army hungers for iron. We need direct control of the other Iron Cities, their blacksmiths' hands, their furnaces' mouths."

 G74_back_with_a_vengeance_title: "Back with a Vengeance"
 G74_back_with_a_vengeance_desc: "what about an anti-ameion coalition? we already had it. we had one yes, what about the second anti-ameion coalition?"

 G74_an_oath_twice_broken_title: "An Oath Twice Broken"
 G74_an_oath_twice_broken_desc: "Twice already our Empire trusted the Mudaliars to keep their loyalty, after we showed them mercy. Twice they broke it, their word worth less than a woman's virtue in their city of sin.\nThere shan't be a third.\nBut can we govern the City without them? Should we even try?"

 G74_the_northern_pretender_title: "The Northern Pretender"
 G74_the_northern_pretender_desc: "Urvand is by far the biggest and most successful of the kingdoms that came out of the Fifth Age of Ambition, even going as far as naming their state Larankar, to signal their dominant position on the region.\nJust. Another. Pretender.\nWe'll take them down like all the others, for we are the only master of Thaychend."

 G74_third_and_eternal_title: "Third and Eternal"
 G74_third_and_eternal_desc: "First came Olokhar, and while his qualities were many big was also his flaw, so much that his own empire collapsed under it.\nSecond came Aldatam, his rise was slower but had better foundations to it. But those same foundations ended up betraying his heirs, each Great-Banner of the Ironblood army fighting for its own pretender, following its Dannasan power games, instead of serving the state.\nThird came Harrihara, and a fourth won't come.\n\nThe Cycle is over, the Empire eternal."

 G74_third_and_eternal_fren_title: "Third And Eternal"
 G74_third_and_eternal_fren_desc: ""

 G74_third_and_eternal_march_title: "Third and Eternal"
 G74_third_and_eternal_march_desc: ""

 G74_a_relic_for_the_fort_title: "A Relic for the Fort"
 G74_a_relic_for_the_fort_desc: "News arrived that a powerful relic was discovered by a Darkalyndar soldier, capable of creating a weak barrier between him and an enemy; Darkalyndar let us know that they're willing to part from the relic for a price, as they don't see an use for it - though whispers say it's because there's already been a death in the court trying to exploit it. No matter, to strenghten the Fort, this and more."

 G74_the_great_kannalulthe_title: "The Great Kannalulthe"
 G74_the_great_kannalulthe_desc: "Oh Kannalulthe! Wonder\nof the Second Empire!\nWalking your roads\nagain, tracing my steps\non your stones, old friend,\nmakes my heart fill up\nwith life, for what has been,\nmy eyes shine\nwith mirth, for what will come.\nThe sorrow for the present\nis ephemeral, a ripple\nin the water over your dam."

 G74_everybody_replaceable_title: "Everybody's Replaceable"
 G74_everybody_replaceable_desc: "Having turned our attention on the elves that makes the army, instead of looking only at those who lead it, we made the most amazing discovery. Our men, soldiers for life, always training or fighting, are perfectly able to go to battle without their "great generals"! Who could have guessed!\nAll we needed to do was allowing the best to rise from the ranks, establishing a clear hierarchy but with fast promotions.\nWith their usefulness greatly reduced and the soldiers loyal to us, it's time we move against the Warlords."

 G74_lean_on_the_warlords_title: "Lean on the Warlords"
 G74_lean_on_the_warlords_desc: "We need to face it, we're weak. A pathetic rump state of what was. We need men, and the warlords have them. They know our need, and will ask for much in exchange. Control of the armies they'll give us, first of all.\n\nBut our history already has seen what happens if the army gets divided in several banners, each his own Dannasan -the commander- private fief. The territory the Iron Banner is supposed to garrison becomes its land, more important to them than the nation; each Great Banner become a separate entity from the others, and has no qualms whatsoever in fighting them to the death - countryman against countryman. We can't let it happen again.\n\nIt's better to grant them the other thing they're interested in: land. But in order to do that, and not ruin ourselves in the meantime, we need to take from others at least part of what we'll give."

 G74_train_them_to_perfection_title: "Train Them to Perfection"
 G74_train_them_to_perfection_desc: "The Second Empire proved what having the only professional army in a sea of poorly trained levies and disloyal mercenaries meant. The Iron Banner system may have failed and dragged us to collapse, but even the War of the Six Emperors needed 20 years of brutal civil war before the Empire would finally come apart at the seams, due to the strenght of our army.\nThis to say, we need to steel, by training or by battle, these so called "soldiers" we got from the warlords and reestablish the Ironblood Army out of them and the rest of our levies.\n\nWe'll deal with the consequences later."

 G74_a_question_of_loyalty_title: "A Question of Loyalty"
 G74_a_question_of_loyalty_desc: "The decision to lean on the Warlords and invest in a permanent army is already showing its poisoned fruits. Warlords and generals aquired a lot of power and, as power begets power, they are quickly increasing it.\nOne would think it should be imperative to keep those strongmen loyal. Wrong.\nTo foster loyalty in someone who's already powerful is always a failing enterprise: unless they're the best of elves, it will be a matter of giving and taking - with always the risk of having somebody able, or willing, to give more who will steal that loyalty away.\nThat's why the focus will be on those who are powerful only in number instead, the common soldier, whose devotion, once gained, is yours to lose.\nBy love, or by fear, their hearths will be ours.\nWhat is a Warlord without an army, anyway?"

 #Events
 gophira.1.t: "Like Cat and Dog"
 gophira.1.d: "Harrihara had a problem. Well two, really.\nThe first, longstanding, one is that He's the rightful ruler of Taychend, last Heir to the greatest empire in history but, under His control? A city and not much more. The rest of His realm is in the hands of traitorous wanna-be kings and propped up bandits incapable of comprehending His majesty.\n\nThe second, more immediate, is that His two advisors, the love of His life and His lifelong friend, the two people in the court he can place his blind trust in, can't stay in the same room for more than five minutes without screaming at each other. Arguing about policies, faith and Heroes, treaties, animal companions, morality, the weather, his son's education, judgements, what HE should eat for dinner...\nToday's matter of discussion is, not for the first time, about styles of government, specifically which of the two Empires of Gophira - Olhokar's and The Second Empire - followed the right direction. Vindar argue Olhokar's way of dealing with defeated enemies - being magnanimous and quick to integrate former foes in the fold - is superior, it prevents bad blood and future revolts; Azhera is a follower of the Second Empire style: every threath to the nation needs to be responded quickly, with ruthless and excessive force. Harrihara would lean on his wife side usually - he has no patience nor piety for anybody who dares to defy his rule - but he heard this back and forth more often than his son's cries, and  couldn't muster strenght to debate any of it."
 gophira.1.1: "Fine! Azhera, you're right, I agree. Now out, both of you!"
 gophira.1.2: "Fine! Vindar, I see your point, let's go with that. Now out, both of you!"

 gophira.2.t: "A Companion for our Son"
 gophira.2.d: ""As you know, since his birthday Thanal has begun pestering his mother, his tutors, even Us, when We go see him, to get him a pet. We approve of this, it's only right and proper that Our heir has a strong animal at his side. Last night Azhera talked about gifting him a Tydhzegaeda cub, saying their independence and ferocity will teach Thanal how to rule. We have to admit few beasts can compete with a jaguar's majesty, and it would serve him well once they'll both grow up. Imagine the boy riding a jaguar to battle!"\n\nHarrihara studied his friend - oh he was imagining it alright! Vindar had the most hilarious expression since the cat was first mentioned -some kind of disgusted horror- and the grimace kept worsening the more he'd talk about it. Scandalizing his straightlaced advisor was neither hard nor unusual, but the joy he had in doing it was always guaranteed.\n"You'd give a barely six years old child one of those beasts! Sure, they may look cute as cubs but in no time at all will grow into a bloodthirsty monster! The chendhyans may keep some as pets you say, they probably do not care that their children risk becoming feline food!/nWhy not a kotakompu instead? A warrior, of course. Those rodents are not lacking when it comes to strenght and resistance, but are extremely obedient towards their owner, as they see him as one of their queens. And how to better teach a young heir to rule than giving him a faithful subject?"\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] paused. That's why he liked Vindar. Even when he had just intended to poke some fun at him, he gained some good advice."
 gophira.2.1: "Thanal, I've got something for you. -meeeew-"
 gophira.2.2: "Damn, this thing's ugly. Son, come here!"
