  #Column 1
  Y72_hidden_gems_title:0 "Hidden Gems"
  Y72_hidden_gems_desc:0 "We have heard rumours of gemstones that can be grown within the Lupulan Rainforest.  While the likelihood of there being a similar deposit of precious rocks to our own is small, it is still worth learning more about.  Let us seed spies among merchants of great influence to find these gems."
  Y72_curio_expedition_title:0 "The Curio Expedition"
  Y72_curio_expedition_desc:0 "With the recent completion of several military outposts on the outskirts of the Lupulan, we can begin to send out larger exploration teams in our search for these mysterious gems.  Using a system of quadranting, we can comb the jungle carefully and avoid missing anything."
  Y72_military_expedition_title:0 "The Military Expedition"
  Y72_military_expedition_desc:0 "Armed with the intelligence gathered by our exploration teams, the time has come for us to assert our dominance over the rainforest and the tribes who live there. Let us depose their so-called “Kings” and bring their misguided followers into our nation."
  Y72_offer_amongst_forest_title:0 "Offer Amongst the Forest"
  Y72_offer_amongst_forest_desc:0 "With the rebellion crushed our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should be rejoicing, but all they can think about is the whispers they have been hearing within the forest. “Endless power I shall bestow to thee, in exchange for aid you give unto me…” "
  Y72_hidden_1_title:0 "Hidden Mission"
  Y72_hidden_1_desc:0 "Our path has yet to be determined."
  Y72_hidden_2_title:0 "Hidden Mission"
  Y72_hidden_2_desc:0 "Our path has yet to be determined."
  Y72_hidden_3_title:0 "Hidden Mission"
  Y72_hidden_3_desc:0 "Our path has yet to be determined."
  Y72_tradition_power_title:0 "Tradition over Power"
  Y72_tradition_power_desc:0 "While our Anroang is not convinced the so-called "spirit" wasn't a trick of the mind, they have announced a number of new festivals in celebration of our rich and unique cultural heritage. The Festival of the Stranger, traditionally celebrated only in rural areas, was always a festival of propitiation and fear, aimed to prevent hostile spirits from taking offence at a poor welcome. The Night of Hungry Winds, though less at odds with spirits, also betrays a note of fear. Let us turn these occasions into joyous feasts, and invite our spirit brethren in from the cold."
  Y72_matter_chi_title:0 "The Matter of Chi"
  Y72_matter_chi_desc:0 "The recent communication between our state and the many spirits has led to the clergy to question the true nature of chi, and how it relates to the spirit plane and the philosophies of a good human life.  Normally such thought would be kept within the monasteries, however the Anroang has taken a newfound interest in theology since her encounter with the spirit in the forest, so let this public debate be funded and known!"
  Y72_oppressors_servants_title:0 "Planar Equality"
  Y72_oppressors_servants_desc:0 "Let it be known that from this day forth, by order of our great Anroang, both humans and spirits are equals in our great nation! Let these spirits come and walk among us, manifesting themselves once more on this physical plane!"
  Y72_learn_from_locals_title:0 "Learn from the Locals"
  Y72_learn_from_locals_desc:0 "While many in our state have begun to adopt the traditions of the Mystic Accord, our understanding of many practices is lacking. We should seek to understand how other followers of the faith in the Lupulan revere the Great Spirits and learn from them."
  Y72_queens_decree_title:0 "The Queen's Decree"
  Y72_queens_decree_desc:0 "With a greater knowledge and understanding of the great spirits, it is time our Anroang proclaims the worship of these spirits the official religion of our nation state. It is time for us to publicly embrace the ways of the Mystic Accord."
  Y72_temple_throne_title:0 "Not a Temple, A Throne"
  Y72_temple_throne_desc:0 "With our conversion to the Mystic Accord underway, it is time we shatter the temple wards holding back our beloved spirits in Nha Nuhoanha. We will transform this temple into a glorious new palace for our Anroangs and welcome the spirits into it!"
  
  #Column 2
  Y72_sharpen_boars_tusks_title:0 "Sharpen the Boar's Tusks"
  Y72_sharpen_boars_tusks_desc:0 "A segment of our military known as ‘The Boars of Dinh’ have proven themselves time and time again in honor of our Anroang.  Devoting their lives to be a stalwart troop of melee prowess, they deserve to be placed separate from the rest of the army as an elite company."
  Y72_end_raiders_title:0 "End the Raiders"
  Y72_end_raiders_desc:0 "The desert raiders of Sirtan have long been a thorn in our great nation's side. Sirtani pillagers tear through the Binhrung countryside, setting fire to villages within the Binhrunghin valley and ripping love ones from each other's arms.  It is time we rid ourselves of this nuisance."
  Y72_drive_elf_lovers_out_title:0 "Drive the Elf-Lovers Out!"
  Y72_drive_elf_lovers_out_desc:0 "Arawkelin rises in power in the south, burning down the great rainforests as they do so. We should check their growth so they will not become a threat, and help preserve the rainforest in the process."
  Y72_help_from_beyond_title:0 "Help from Beyond"
  Y72_help_from_beyond_desc:0 "While we have stopped Arawkelin's immediate rise to power, the rainforests they own still burn. The spirits of the rainforest call for our aid, and we will answer."
  Y72_seize_coastline_title:0 "Seize the Coastline"
  Y72_seize_coastline_desc:0 "With the rainforests secured, it is time we seize the coastline and the cities located there. In doing so, we shall cement our claim as rulers of the Lupulan, and secure our southern border once and for all."
  Y72_reconnect_heritage_title:0 "Reconnect our Heritage"
  Y72_reconnect_heritage_desc:0 "The beast of industrialisation rages in our lands, and maintaining a balance between it and nature is a fine line we walk. In the midst of this, our people have begun returning to our ancestral home on the jungle's fringes."

  #Column 3
  Y72_avenge_our_queen_title:0 "Avenge Our Queen"
  Y72_avenge_our_queen_desc:0 "One war ends, and with it the Unkillable Kai lies beaten and bleeding. The Anroang has ensured that our people's memory shall endure, but she looks now to her environs. The ethereal emperor of Hon Sai yet lingers, but the court whispers that his presence ebbs by the day. The Kai remain divided, and the Mountain King sneers from a throne built on the backs of the Hinphat. Their time will come. For now, we will recover."
  Y72_unite_old_kingdom_title:0 "Unite the Old Kingdom"
  Y72_unite_old_kingdom_desc:0 "Duyen is avenged. We have routed the last of Kudet Kai's forces. While this loathsome state has proven time and time again to be capable of naught but destruction, its people can be redeemed. The Binhrung shall accept them as our rightful subjects, and soon Kudet Kai will be nothing more than a memory to Haless."
  Y72_mountain_kings_servants_title:0 "The Mountain King's Servants"
  Y72_mountain_kings_servants_desc:0 "The Mountain King trembles before the Anroang, surrounded by swaths of his Hinphat sycophants. As she lifts her arms to bring her warhammer down, they gasp in horror, held back by our soldiers - but it is his nephrite crown that is broken. She stretches a hand out to the crownless dwarf, and he rises shakily. The disbelief of the Hinphat turns, slowly, to awe. Perhaps even the lowliest people can be shown the way, in time. With our guidance, master and servant become equals."
  Y72_laid_to_rest_title:0 "Laid to Rest"
  Y72_laid_to_rest_desc:0 "The tides of change have shifted. The Khom Civil War is past us now. As the Ghostly Emperor fades, so too does his state; we shall give it a proper burial. With this threat to our hegemony dispelled, we stand poised to unify the Kai under the guidance of our noble and righteous Anroang."
  Y72_rein_in_townships_title:0 "Rein in the Townships"
  Y72_rein_in_townships_desc:0 "While the Kai townships boast great political freedom, they are incapable of protecting themselves from the chaos and instability that freedom brings. As protectors of the Kai, we must intervene and bring them stability and security."
  Y72_rulers_yanglam_kai_title:0 "Rulers of the Yanglam & Kai"
  Y72_rulers_yanglam_kai_desc:0 "We have achieved our goals and are now the defenders of the Kai and Langlam peoples. We are united and prosperous, and yet our Anroang feels…unsatisfied. Now still the look with hungry eyes beyond our borders, an Imperial dream, and a voice relentlessly whispering “an endless desire power is, more of it we always need.”."
  Y72_reforged_crown_title:0 "The Reforged Crown"
  Y72_reforged_crown_desc:0 "The Anroang arrives in the great palace to meet with her ancestors. Taken in by the scent of low-cooked beef, stirred with spinach and savory fish sauce, it is a glorious day of festivities and mirth. Our people, protected and content, celebrate our great empire and all its achievements, and the great Anroangs of old celebrate with us, for at long last, both spirit and mortal have a place to live in unity."
  
  #Column 4
  Y72_reopen_gem_caves_title:0 "Reopen the Gem Caves"
  Y72_reopen_gem_caves_desc:0 "The recent earthquake in Keoaden has closed off many of the lower tunnels and caves in our mines. With the Khom Civil War over, it is time we turn our focus on reopening these levels."
  Y72_eyes_open_trade_title:0 "Eyes over Open Trade"
  Y72_eyes_open_trade_desc:0 "With the discovery of gemstones with significant magical potential, our Anroang has decreed that there will be additional oversight of the gem trade in our major cities."
  Y72_untouched_hillsides_title:0 "Untouched Hillsides"
  Y72_untouched_hillsides_desc:0 "Historicially, precious rocks have held all sorts of symbolism for Chien Binhrung; They are a sign of nobility, a material used for burial, and a lucrative trade export.  If we want to fuel the latter use for gems in our kingdom, we need to discover more deposits of precious rocks throughout our realm."
  Y72_precious_rocks_title:0 "Around Haless in 80 Months"
  Y72_precious_rocks_desc:0 "The discovery of gems laced with magic has led to a surge of curiosity within the Binhrung court. Could there be other gem deposits in Haless that boost magic potential?  Could other arcane gems be used to better commune with the Spitirual Anorangs?  To learn more, we should fund a daring continent-wide expedition across the region in search of other rumored deposits of ‘Magic Gems."
  Y72_hold_within_mine_title:0 "A Hold within a Mine"
  Y72_hold_within_mine_desc:0 "With Verkal Ozovar taken, we are presented a unique opportunity. While we have no use for a hold, we do have use for the vast minerals in the mountain. With the help of the local Dwarven clans, we shall convert Verkal Ozovar into the largest mine in all Haless."
  Y72_incorporate_ozovar_weapons_title:0 "Unbreakable Steel"
  Y72_incorporate_ozovar_weapons_desc:0 "Recent insights from expeditions in Verkal Ozovar have yielded us breakthroughs in armoursmithing. These combined with our renowned gem-encrusted armour has culminated with our soldiers being protected with some of the best armour in Haless!"
  Y72_invulnerable_hearts_title:0 "Invulnerable Hearts"
  Y72_invulnerable_hearts_desc:0 "Born from the fires of war, military leaders have always held great influence in our court. We have thrived best when the military is integrated into the core of our policies and doctrines. This integration has begun to manifest in our generals becoming the face of our armies. Let us work with them to cultivate our ideals in our military tactics and strategies."
  Y72_new_interrogation_title:0 "Interrogation Tactics"
  Y72_new_interrogation_desc:0 "We have long crystalised our Anroangs when they die to tie their spirits to the physical realm, in hopes they will aid us in times of crisis.  The precious Jade stone has, however, long been a stained gem after the infamous ‘Foul Speared’ Anroang was crystalised with it. We can use this process as a great deterrent against rebellious elements. Nobody wants a hand made of Jade after all…"
  Y72_heirs_thindikai_title:0 "True Heirs to Thindikai"
  Y72_heirs_thindikai_desc:0 "From humble beginnings we have flourished, and we now stand as the successors of Thidinkai. Our court is ecstatic, yet hungry for more, and ambitions fester in shadowed corners. Our people rejoice, for we have brought them peace, security, and prosperity, and so they are happy. And our Spirit Queens are proud, for we have realised their dreams and ambitions, and they walk amongst us, with smiles of pride on their hallowed faces."
  
  #Column 5
  Y72_coronation_title:0 "$MONARCH$'s Coronation"
  Y72_coronation_desc:0 "With the Khom Civil War over, it is time for us to focus on our internal affairs, beginning with the coronation of our Anroang! A coronation of the grandest proportions is in order, given that our people have dealt a crushing blow to our hated enemies in Kudet Kai."
  Y72_visit_temple_title:0 "A Visit to the Temple"
  Y72_visit_temple_desc:0 "Chien Binhrung is in an interesting position. While we may have bested our enemies in the Khom Civil War, our position as a regional power is still tenuous. Falter but a little, and all may come undone. Searching for counsel on how to proceed, our Anroang will visit the Nha Nuhoanha temple, seeking out the wisdom of rulers past."
  Y72_meeting_with_knives_title:0 "A Meeting with the Knives"
  Y72_meeting_with_knives_desc:0 "Our Anroang sits in the council chamber surrounded by master spymasters and assassins, gained from the dismantling of many of the estates' former networks. Now these networks should be utilised by the state to subvert the power of the nobles and dispel independence movements through propaganda."
  Y72_nrpd_title:0 "The NRPD Overseers"
  Y72_nrpd_desc:0 "With our increasing oversight of the trading activities within our state, some are beginning to question how open and free our trade is. We must invoke some creative tactics in order to maintain our facade of open trade. Thus, the Anroang has founded the National Resource Protection Division."
  Y72_end_noble_merchant_title:0 "End the Estate's Feuds"
  Y72_end_noble_merchant_desc:0 "The clergy have long been loyal to the crown, with their power having been broken after a failed attempt to create a Eunuch state akin to those in Yanshen. The nobility and merchants, however, are not so loyal, often using the turmoil of succession to further their own agendas, press old rivalries and consolidate power. While our spys have allowed us to check their power, perhaps it is time the status quo became more to our liking…"
  Y72_sapphire_declaration_title:0 "The Sapphire Declaration"
  Y72_sapphire_declaration_desc:0 "We have been taking steps to limit the estates' influence recently, but now it is time we end this charade. Let us break the power of the estates so they can never again presume to have authority. There is only one authority in our nation, and it is our Anroang."
  Y72_bejeweled_city_title:0 "A Bejeweled City"
  Y72_bejeweled_city_desc:0 "Keoaden started with humble roots, founded after gems were discovered in the Northern hills, nestled in the shadows of the Nha Nohoanha temple complex. After dwarven migrants to the town helped establish the mines, gemstones have dominated both the city’s culture and its exports. Thanks to clever manoeuvering, strong leadership, and aid from the spirit queens, Chien Binhrung has ascended to its rightful place holding dominion over all of South Haless, gathering a crown of great cities in the process. However, none shine brighter than Keoaden, the crown jewel of our Empire, and the place where it all began."
  
##Events
  flavor_chien.1.t:0 "Ending the Blood Feud"
  flavor_chien.1.d:0 "To Kudet Kai, Anroang Duyen has long served as a trophy. She was first slain, then ridiculed, then confined to a funerary urn. With the disgrace of her erstwhile captors, we prepared to welcome her body to its rightful place in Nha Nuhoanha Temple. As our soldiers breached the walls of Nirakvondikai accompanied by our Anroang herself, they sang songs of vengeance and triumph. The city's mortuary sanctum, once proud, now ran red with the blood of the so-called Unkillable Kai. In victory, however, came a crushing revelation.\n\nDuyen's urn is not here.\n\nPanic turned to terrible purpose. Nirakvondikai burned bright that night."
  flavor_chien.1.a:0 "...A query for later.  For now, we must rest."
  flavor_chien.2.t:0 "A Pointless Chase"
  flavor_chien.2.d:0 "The Binhrung soldiers were having a difficult time, navigating the many halls and corners of the Nephrite Hold.  Not only was the underground city a labyrinthine complex of alleyways and structures, but the local population wasn’t exactly keen on assisting their recent conquerors.\n\nThe Soldiers were not just patrolling Verkal Ozovar, however.  Anroang [Root.Monarch.GetName] had assigned multiple contingents of troops on one of many leads related to Duyen’s Urn, which was so silently ripped from our nation’s grasp during the Razing of Nirakvondikai.  Rumors abound that a few loyal remnants of Kudet Kai entrusted the Urn to be taken through the hold, though the direction they went, or the building they hid, remained a mystery.\n\nThe longer Duyen’s Urn was left undiscovered, the more time these ruffians had to whisk away into the shadows.  Though the reason for this expansive search was not abundantly clear, the Urn had become the Anorang’s highest priority."
  flavor_chien.2.a:0 "Time is of the Essence"
  flavor_chien.3.t:0 "Phasmophobia"
  flavor_chien.3.d:0 "Of course.\n\nThe Ghostly visage of Sang Caoban, who had so selfishly clung onto power, had been the mastermind behind Duyen’s disappearance all this time.  It was he who had people sneak into Nirakvondikai in the night, robbing us of the remains of our beloved ruler.  It was he who tried to deceive our soldiers through the halls of Verkal Ozovar, throwing false leads and rumors to throw us off.  Now the urn rests in his palace, mere steps away from where his incorporeal form stands hauntingly before Anorang [Root.Monarch.GetName] now.\n\nTo [Root.Monarch.GetName], it did not matter what the purpose behind this thievery was.  It did not matter how the Ghost Emperor planned to desecrate Duyen with his foul magic.  All that mattered was that the urn would shortly be returned to the royal palace in Keoaden, and that Caoban’s corrupted unlife was put to an end."
  flavor_chien.3.d1:0 "Of course.\n\nThe Ghostly visage of Sang Caoban, who had so selfishly clung onto power, had been the mastermind behind Duyen’s disappearance all this time.  It was he who had people sneak into Nirakvondikai in the night, robbing us of the remains of our beloved ruler.  It was he who tried to deceive our soldiers through the halls of Verkal Ozovar, throwing false leads and rumors to throw us off.  Now the urn rests in his palace, discarded among many other trinkets and baubles, its prior purpose lost when the Ghost Emperor past on.\n\nAnroang [Root.Monarch.GetName] had ordered the Boars of Dinh to carefully sweep the palace for any other loyalists to the deceased emperor’s cause, while she proceeded to grab the urn so delicately, caressing it in a full embrace.\n\n“Beloved Ancestor”, Anorang [Root.Monarch.GetName] declared, “You will be home soon.”"
  flavor_chien.3.a:0 "The Hunt is Over."
  flavor_chien.4.t:0 "A Curious Find"
  flavor_chien.4.d:0 "The hills north of Keoaden are dotted with an intricate network of mineshafts, excavating the precious rocks that fill both the caverns below the earth and the pockets of Binhrung merchants.  Normally, the mines would be rife with activity, however, as if coinciding with the Khom Civil War, a massive cave-in caused much of the mining system to shut down.\n\nLuckily, that time is behind us, and a fine mix of garnets, topazes, and rubies are being mined out of the system once again.  Our fine [Root.Monarch.GetName] was visiting one of the more prominent mines when the manager of the complex, a Dwarven merchant sporting a brown beard laced with sapphires, approached our Anroang.\n\n“Esteemed Ruler, we bring astonishing news; Some of the gems found deep in the earth seem to house a strange energy to them!  A hired mage seems to believe that this ruby is holding a faint trace of the arcane!”\n\nIf this is true, it could be a great conduit for our ruler, or a good way to raise prices on gems…"
  flavor_chien.4.a:0 "Magic is value, let's find some bidding merchants!"
  flavor_chien.4.b:0 "Only our Queen shall know of this."
  flavor_chien.5.t:0 "Not a Plea, Nor a Demand"
  flavor_chien.4.d:0 "It’s a quiet voice, one that utters barely a whisper in the dense jungles of the Lupulan.\n\nIt calls to our ruler, as if the voice knows her importance.\n\nAs the royal guard marches through the stormy day, the Anroang stops, listening to a sequence  of sounds forming a few phrases of common.\n\nThe sounds echo a fire, raging through the rainforest in the south\n\nThe fire roars with malice, that of a thousand souls writhing in pain\n\nThe souls dissolve into a whisper once more.\n\nThey afford an accord."
  flavor_chien.5.a:0 "I Accept."

  flavor_chien.11.b:0 "To Yanshen and Beyond!"
  flavor_chien.12.t:0 "Spiritual Lapidary"
  flavor_chien.12.d:0 "The process for Spiritual Lapidary is simple.\n\nThe first stage involves entering the Nha Nuhoanha Temple alone, with a piece of jewelry that holds a precious rock imbued with some arcane power.  You approach an open, empty room, arms across your chest, hoping in your mind for a guiding voice.  If the call is received, then shut your eyes.  Your body will be led down a staircase once blind to your eye, and the smell of burning incense will engulf your senses.  Once you know it is time, open your eyes.\n\nBefore you lie the ghostly visages of the Great Queens of Chien Binhrung, heeding your call for help.  You will have the choice to commune with one of the heroes of the nation.  Each of them specializes in some form of nation-building, be it conquest, development, or internal affairs.  Once the choice is made, place the jewelry down. The chosen spirit will seem to envelop the jewel for a time.  Before long, the jewel will glow with a dim violet light, and the process will be complete.  The spirit will be able to lend you  consistent advice and mystical power, regardless of distance from the temple complex.  §TAs the nation seems to rise in power, so too does the spirit queen’s ability to imbue clear knowledge and project greater power.§\n\nNow, who will you choose to commune with?"

  flavor_chien.13.a:0 "Wonderful!"
  flavor_chien.13.b:0 "Lets not disrupt the local industry."
  flavor_chien.14.t:0 "Amethyst of Sarhal"
  flavor_chien.14.d:0 "Captain’s log, [GetDate].\n\nOur fleet found itself cautiously trending through the mouth of the Gulf of Rahen, weary for the many pirate fleets that roamed the area.  Unfortunately, we were not cautious enough, as one of our front ships blared the horn for being attacked.  Fortunately, however, these pirate were not in the business of ransaking us.\n\nThe commotion of a large fleet of Binhrung ships had not gone unnoticed, it seems.  The Naleni harpies of the Sarhali Coast, known for their expertise in their ‘hostile acquiring’ of goods over sea, offered an interesting treatise to me; They’ll allow us, and future chien fleets, safe passage through the gulf, and in exchange we let them in on some of the goods we plan to grab for our Anorang.  As trying to bluff ignorance would likely lead to a sword at my throat, I could only accept.\n\nAs a token of good will (or a reminder of the deal we had to make), the Harpies handed us a small crate.  Inside were some amethysts from their homeland.  After our expedition’s appasier took a look, the gems were determined to house small illusion magic, making them look far shiner and refined then they truly were.  Whether this was intended to scam us or to show interest in our expedition is unknown, but we accepted the crate regardless."

##Decisions
  flavor_chien_30_title:0 "Venerate Nhitrac"
  flavor_chien_30_desc:0 "Our late Queen Nhitrac Trung saw to it that our state would not be subjected by the ravenous Kudet Kai or the Khom Emperor's manipulative son.  She should not just be honored through a ruby-oriented petrification, but worshipped as one of our finest rulers!"
  flavor_chien_31_title:0 "Save Duyen"
  flavor_chien_31_desc:0 "With Duyen's remains recovered and a ritual site prepared, we will use forbidden magic offered to us by [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] and the opals from the Necropolis to restore The Lost Queen's spirit to this world."
  flavor_chien_32_title:0 "Change Current Spirit Queen"
  flavor_chien_32_desc:0 "The queens of old trust our government implicitly.  Once per ruler lifetime, we may switch which spirit queen offers us aid.  This shift may cause mild unrest due to some disruption in policy, but otherwise should not cause too much harm."

##Reforms
  chien_ancestral_council_reform: "Ancestral Council"
  chien_ancestral_council_reform_desc: "The presence of the many estates within our court is no longer required to manage a stable Aministration.  On the contrary, the spiritual Anroang’s have manifested enough willpower to consistently provide support and advice to our living ruler, doing away with any complex court drama that could come with ambitious nobles or rich merchants.  When servants gossip about how it seems impossible for one living person to administer so much, they do not know how close there words are to grasping the truth behind the functions of the Binhrung state."
  chien_planar_equality_reform: "Planar Equality"
  chien_planar_equality_reform_desc: "A series of legislation and laws put in place to give spirits the right to exist as citizens of the state.  While more of a formality as the spirits don't care about material laws, it allows the state to act in domestic matters ‘On behalf of the spiritual plane’, which comes in handly against greedy landowners.  The gesture has seemed to be appreciated by some spirits as well, who have begun to appear near some of the greatest thinkers in our state, offering wisdom from beyond."
