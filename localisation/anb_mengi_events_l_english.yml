 mengimonuments_events.1.d:0 ""Before Izenwez, the legend goes, no Mengi knew what joy meant. While fun and happy things would happen, there was no sense of what they really did for our people. We simply lived our lives as slaves to great unknown masters, chained in spectral bonds. Then Amilak guided us like lambs to show how our simple tools, hammers, stakes, axes, and even crooks could break those chains. In remembrance of this fact we show what these crooks can do."- An anonymous gabare. \n\nThe origins of Izenwez are hazy; fragmentary evidence exists for the game's existence dating very far back, but whatever its origin is, it has our people enamored. From villages to large cities, most have an area to play, be it a simple field with modified rules to the more traditional wood-lined pit. Countless times a month and on festival days 14 people, 7 against 7, take their crooks and play. Now with E Arenaginku Adras partially restored, the game can be played as it was in Zenidir's time. Though the stone seating is no longer cushioned, the wall no longer lined with emerald, the hall is more than functional and ready to accept nobility and commoners alike to watch a game."

 mengimonuments_events.2.t:0 "Izenwez! Izenwez! Izenwez!"
 mengimonuments_events.2.d:0 "...the crowd chants. The game is close to over with the last candle almost a puddle, the ball seems as if it has spent the entire game in the air. It's 1 to 3, yet both teams play as if fatigue were merely a word unheard. The team counts are still seven to seven, yet all have received the honor of injury. Even from Zenidir’s box - nay, yours - you can see the bruises and scrapes down in the pit. Suddenly, an upset; the losing team scores. It's now 2 to 3, though they still have much work to do. Both teams continue the ferocity, checking each other with elbows to the back and kicks to the shins. The ball is slung one last time as the horn is blown; though it misses its mark, you can't but feel proud of what you have seen."
 mengimonuments_events.2.a:0 "Izenwez truly represents the martial nature of our people."

 mengimonuments_events.3.d:0 "“...the crowd chants. Your focus on the game wanes as you look around the crowd, seeing joyous faces. You wave out to them, and for a moment a section of the crowd is watching you, cheering, before shifting their gaze back to the pit. You look around your box to see the various elites of the nation sharing glasses of tej; for a brief moment putting their rivalries behind to enjoy the game. Somebody scores, and you’re consumed in the game again, happy in knowing what Izenwez can bring."
 mengimonuments_events.3.a:0 "Izenwez can always help unify the nation."

 mengimonuments_events.4.d:0 "...the crowd chants for the final time tonight. The game has ended; you watch as men women and children file out of the great hall and down the slopes of the mountain. From your vantage you see them file down into the various towns and villages into the valley below. You are approached then by the leader of one of these valley towns; the restarted games have allowed his town in the valley below to make substantial wealth from the various traders and travelers from surrounding kingdoms, and they want to present a gift to you personally. Before you can say anything he presents the wealth to you and makes his way down to the valley."
 mengimonuments_events.4.a:0 "Izenwez can bring wealth to the nation."

 mengimonuments_events.5.d:0 "...the crowd chants. Now the emerald walls are fully restored. The images of heroes and members of the Warhost of Wind adorn it in all their viridescent glory. Their actions and deeds are looked upon by the masses, serving as inspiration for all peoples both foreign and domestic. Their majesty inspires even you, their stories filling you with determination as they do for all in the hall. Now you look back to the pit to see the players struggling against each other, knowing in your heart why they play."
