 J84_1_2_setting_the_sun_title: "Setting the Sun"
 J84_1_2_setting_the_sun_desc: "The “Jaherian Exemplars” – the prodigal sons and daughters of Tacenie’s empire. They came to Taychend to disperse the darkness, but in their arrogance they made two mistakes. First, they awoke a force even they could not control, their words the spark to the greatest peasant and slave movement since Vehasha’s own. Secondly, they underestimated us. Underestimated our people, underestimated our power, underestimated our history. They seek to destroy everything that made us great – but we will not let them."

 J84_1_4_hero_cults_of_the_exemplary_title: "Hero-Cults of the Exemplary"
 J84_1_4_hero_cults_of_the_exemplary_desc: "The Exemplars are powerful beyond measure, a military and religious organisation without equal – but they turned their power to foolish pursuits, chasing shadows across Aelantir and beyond. Their organisation is so similar to the organisation of our own Hero-Cults and religious brotherhoods – if we turned their cult of exemplary into a cult of glory, we could use their power in the expansion of our Empire, while the Warlord-Heralds do what they wish with the Dry Coast. \n\nThere are, of course, those who view this as a fool’s errand too – should this effort prove too difficult, we can simply expel these prodigal elves, and fold the Taychendi immigrants who had moved to their lands into our empire."

 J84_1_5_ending_an_exile_title: "Ending an Exile"
 J84_1_5_ending_an_exile_desc: "The Dugui’hi, the original denizens of the Mushroom Forest to the north. Their mercenaries and travelling alchemists have been a notable if uncommon sight through Taychend since their exile in the 1200s – but all know their eyes have always been on their original home. The Advakhalla of Sedregenghi were close to supporting an effort to end their exile in the mid 1400s, but the venture failed – by finishing the job, we may be able to add to our empire a valuable new province indeed, as the riches of the Mushroom Forest will flow to us from a grateful people."

 J84_1_7_strategic_herbicide_title: "Strategic Herbicide"
 J84_1_7_strategic_herbicide_desc: "The jungle to the north has always been an impenetrable wall, but the world has changed – war has changed! We are no longer the frightened children skirting the edge of the jungle, stealing wood and hunting the dregs that crawl out of the treeline – with the secrets of artificery opening themselves to us, the possibility of launching an organised campaign of colonisation against the Effelai has become tantalisingly real! First, however, we must decide exactly how much of these new weapons we wish to deploy against the jungle…"

 J84_1_8_bloom_and_bust_title: "Bloom and Bust"
 J84_1_8_bloom_and_bust_desc: "So the jungle finally wakes, and seeks to destroy us? So be it – our battle shall be legendary! As the Effelai blooms, our mages and artificers believe that we now have a golden opportunity to destroy it for good.\n\nAt a command, the orders can be sent out, the warlords called to the Imperial banner – soon, two-hundred thousand will march on the jungle, flame-throwing staves and sparkdrive cannon in their hands. The Effelai blooms – let’s make it go bust!"

 J84_1_9_there_stood_the_grass_title: "There Stood the Grass"
 J84_1_9_there_stood_the_grass_desc: "As our artificers and mages scavenge the effelai’s “corpse”, we have discovered that our victory may not be as total as we thought – and we have realised that may not be such a bad thing. The Effelai is not truly dead, but fractured – and those fractured remnants might be controllable.\n\nIf we are to advance, you must seize those remnants, turn them to use. Ignore opposition, ignore your hesitation – where once stood living grass, now lies reanimated power."

 J84_1_10_a_fleet_born_of_fire_title: "A Fleet Born of Fire"
 J84_1_10_a_fleet_born_of_fire_desc: "The scourged forest held many secrets, but above all those it also had a wealth of high-quality lumber. Already some of our warlords have moved north, setting up camps through the scorched remains of the Effelai. Go and sponsor these Woodcutter-Warlords, and connect their camps to newly built shipyards along the Effelai coast.\n\nSoon, we shall begin converting the jungle’s riches into the greatest fleet the world has ever seen – born of fire, and more glorious than flame!"

 J84_1_11_fear_on_every_state_title: "Fear on Every Shore"
 J84_1_11_fear_on_every_state_desc: "More ships leave our Effelai shipyards by the day – so build more.\n\nOur fleets grow, and the oceans of Halann reveal themselves to vainglorious eyes, battle-hungry and blood-thirsty – so let them off the leash.\n\nWhen you’re finished, and we rule the ocean? Nobody will ever look at the sea again and feel safe."

 J84_2_2_institutional_apotheosis_title: "Institutional Apotheosis"
 J84_2_2_institutional_apotheosis_desc: "The veneration of a ruler’s ancestors is a powerful tool in any warlord’s playbook. It allows one to cast themselves as having the personal favour of those gods, by virtue of blood, and provides a direct channel with which any subject can direct sacrifices and offerings to the ruling dynasty. The Imperial Cult, therefore, is a vital part of any Taychendi empire – and it will be for our own as well. By building temples to the imperial family’s deceased members and previous rulers, and investing into a powerful organisation that will oversee the various hero-cults to those ascended gods, we can entrench the image of the imperial family, and remind all of the glory of our empire."

 J84_2_3_the_weaver_of_fates_title: "The Weaver of Fates"
 J84_2_3_the_weaver_of_fates_desc: "The Fateweaver of Korrimutren is one of the most powerful oracles anywhere in the world, a great divination relic hooked directly into the skeletal corpse of a Precursor mage, that can allow a powerful enough divination mage to see directly – and almost always truly – into the future. The Fateweaver’s predictions have driven Taychendi history – they sparked the Chendhyan invasions, brought low the First Gophiran empire and in the process ensured the Second Empire’s rise, and, of course, it granted Laskaris the Conqueror a fate-woven shield of quasi-immortality that would spur his conquests in Taychend. We cannot leave fate to chance – it is time [Root.Monarch.GetName] paid the Weaver of Fates a visit."

 J84_2_4_agricultural_evolution_title: "Agricultural Evolution"
 J84_2_4_agricultural_evolution_desc: "The land of Taychend, and the three great rivers that dominate it – the Vyech, the Endioka, the Kalavend – is one of the most bountiful in Taychend. When the glaciers melt, and the storm clouds gather, the farms of Taychend produce enough grain to feed tens of millions. At the height of the Second Gophiran Empire, it is said that Taychend’s goliath agricultural base supported a population of 40 million – but the death throes of Gophira ravaged that base. By 1400, the Taychendi population had dropped by half. If we are to become the greatest empire Taychend has ever seen, we will need to invest in plant growth magic, grain silos, irrigation – and not just expand, but evolve that which feeds our cities and our armies."

 J84_2_5_paths_of_ascention_title: "Paths of Ascention"
 J84_2_5_paths_of_ascention_desc: "The Violet Library, the venerable institution that formed the heart of the enlightened and prosperous Dannuka Dumrusvarn of Taychendi late antiquity, is known for expending tremendous effort into documenting the deeds of any god heroes they can find, storing tens of thousands of records within their labyrinthine archives.\n\nIn their efforts, they have developed a concept called “the Thousand Paths of Ascension”, which seeks to highlight paths aside from warfare that can lead to apotheosis. If we are to build a glorious empire, we need our smiths, our architects, our dockhands, our shopkeeps and bakers – we cannot have everyone throwing themselves into the fray of battle. Perhaps, then, it may be worth officially supporting this idea?"

 J84_2_7_unravelling_divinity_title: "Unravelling Divinity"
 J84_2_7_unravelling_divinity_desc: "The Ravelians are a group dedicated to uncovering the secrets of Halann and beyond – and, as their organisation spreads through the tendrils of Cannor’s colonial networks, we are beginning to understand just how many secrets they have uncovered.\n\nAdvanced knowledge of shadowy organisations, extraplanar exploration, artificer knowledge that would put even the Vustarin to shame… already, some of our warlords have been trying to gain the Ravelian’s trust, and thus access to their secrets – but before we can officially sanction this, we must learn more about this new group."

 J84_2_8_the_gifts_of_cerachmanu_title: "The Gifts of Cerachmanu"
 J84_2_8_the_gifts_of_cerachmanu_desc: "Cerachmanu, what we call the prisons beneath the world, and the Cannorians call the Infernal Planes. It is a dark place, full of beings as evil as they are powerful – and that power has proven itself attractive to many in Taychend through the years.\n\nVarious Taychendi groups, like the Cennayakuta of Imarchend, have a long history of consorting with devils and demons. With new knowledge from the Ravelian archives now available to us, it is high time you exploited that which lies away from the eyes of the gods."

 J84_2_10_sanguosynthesis_title: "Sanguosynthesis"
 J84_2_10_sanguosynthesis_desc: "At their core, elves are animals. We are born, we eat, we reproduce, we die. But we reproduce to our limit. Taychendi families are – the Imperial Population is – only so large as our resources allow. And our army is only so large as our population is.\n\nBut we reproduce to our limit. So build more farms, increase production, render our fields fertile. And with the fruit of the ground, the blood of the earth? Fuel the blood of conquest… people. Bodies for the war machine, for the banners, uncountable and infinite.\n\nTaychend rises to its limit. Raise it."

 J84_2_11_orphans_of_aesadas_title: "Orphans of Aesadas"
 J84_2_11_orphans_of_aesadas_desc: "The Ozgar orcs have grown restless under the control of a slaving empire such our own – so we’ll have to force them to kneel. There is one thing both them and us know for real – might makes right. And so an Ozarm’Chadash will decide this issue. You must fight in it.\n\nAfter that, the fate of the Orphans of Aesadas is in your hands. Ducaniel, the scion of Aesadas, created them, but even he didn’t have that power. They slipped through his grasp – they will not slip through ours. Isn’t that glorious?"

 J84_3_1_a_warlord_empire_title: "A Warlord Empire"
 J84_3_1_a_warlord_empire_desc: "Ebenanth, Yodhan, Varanash, Ultarlan, Olhokar – we stand in the same place those great conquerors once stood: unifier of Taychend. But we are only here because the empires of those elves crumbled after their deaths, as they either exploded into rebellion or stagnated and weakened over decades – we must not repeat the same mistake.\n\nWe are an empire of warlords – our power is built on them, and our future greatness will be won by them. But unlike our predecessors, as our conquests bring those warlords loot and plunder, we will not waste those riches – our ambition and our glory will be the crucible that will raise cities, monuments, bend the way of the world itself! Taychend will rise once more, as the empire to end all empires, and Taychend will rise alone, by it’s own strength – as the Empire Vainglorious!"

 J84_3_3_vaona_gophira_title: "Vaona Gophira"
 J84_3_3_vaona_gophira_desc: "The Gophirans moved millions of elven slaves across their empire at their height, using them to construct great monuments and extract the resources of their empire. Though we must do the same, there is a great problem – we can no longer rely on the wars of glory, the unrestricted wars between warlords, that truly supported Taychend’s slave population. To kickstart our slave economy, we must look abroad for new targets, and stimulate the various slave markets through our empire. Only then can the Periyodhai, the constant semi-ritualised battles between warlords and city-states, sustain the cycle of terror and brutality that underpins the engines of vainglory."

 J84_3_4_a_land_of_cities_title: "A Land of Cities"
 J84_3_4_a_land_of_cities_desc: "In Taychend, the city-state is the base unit of politics and society. They range in size from walled farming-villages to great metropolises, their warlords ranging from respected community members appointed by their community to absolutist warlord-kings, who can command tens of thousands of warriors. Care must be paid to those small city-states, of course – but that is the job of the greater ones. By investing in those greater city states, we can create scores of star-like cities, that radiate their prosperity out to the territories under their control."

 J84_3_6_beyond_taychend_title: "Beyond Taychend"
 J84_3_6_beyond_taychend_desc: "Andeios is ours. The heart of southern Aelantir, a land of magnificent cities, great peoples, legendary stories and myths, is now under our total control. But as we have so dearly learned, there is a world beyond Taychend – the Empire Vainglorious may rise alone, but it will not rise in isolation.\n\nNew ways of dealing with magic are being pioneered, new religions, professing ancient truths and possessing cutting-edge innovations, are sprouting up across the world. And the warlords, gorged on the vainglory of their conquests, are clamouring for new foes to invade, new riches to plunder – and as news of new discoveries arrive in our ports, they clamour for new secrets to unlock and powers to gain. We won’t deny their demands. \n\nOne wonders if we could…"

 J84_3_7_no_stone_unturned_title: "No Stone Unturned"
 J84_3_7_no_stone_unturned_desc: "The Slaver-Nobles, the Precursor elves who used to rule Taychend before the ruin, left countless ruins dotting the landscape of Taychend. While many of them have already been ransacked for artefacts and relics, or even dismantled for their Precursor steel and scrap, there remains a great many of them hidden below ground, out of sight – but not necessarily out of reach. We need more relics for our burgeoning experiments with Artificery – and if we have to dig up half of Taychend to find them, so be it!"

 J84_3_8_the_way_of_warlords_title: "The Way of Warlords"
 J84_3_8_the_way_of_warlords_desc: "To the warlords, might makes right, victory makes glory – and autonomy allows more victory. It is those beliefs, however, that caused so much trouble for empires past.\n\nThere are two approaches to this problem – one follows the path of the Mudaliars: to sit up on the high chair and make oneself an aid, not a hindrance, to the ambitions of your subordinates. The other is the path of the Gophirans – assert your power, remind your vassals that a restrained warlord can win more glory than a dead one. If we are to further Imperial power, you will need to pick that."

 J84_3_9_the_new_relic_lords_title: "The New Relic-Lords"
 J84_3_9_the_new_relic_lords_desc: "Since the Ruin, the Taychendi have been using the relics of the past to win glory in the present, powerful magical artefacts destroying armies and sundering cities. But the world is changing, and as kingdoms of glory turns into an Empire of Vainglory, warlords must change with them. \n\nThe new practice of Artificery will revolutionise our armies – and in doing so, the Relic-Lords of a new age shall rise, the Techno-Warlords unleashed. Integrate artificery into your military, hone your strengths, discard your weaknesses. Do that, and the world shall tremble."

 J84_3_10_in_heaven_and_halann_title: "In Heaven and Halann"
 J84_3_10_in_heaven_and_halann_desc: "In the material world, our armies sweep all before them. With sabre and staff, sparkdrive and cannon, Taychend’s supremacy is won through blood and fire.\n\nIt is not enough. Make the Imperial Cult supreme, be that by canonisation or apotheosis. Then, we shall raise your ancestors, as gods or saints, to divine rulership. Soon, our glory will stretch across planes – and your blood shall rule in both Heaven and Halann."

 J84_3_11_an_empire_vainglorious_title: "An Empire Vainglorious"
 J84_3_11_an_empire_vainglorious_desc: "Our banners have conquered lands never seen before, our adventurers delved into ruins not uncovered in centuries, our artificers created weapons never tested. Our ambition knows no bounds. Our vainglory disregards the concept entirely.\n\nTaychend has risen, and it will rise further. We’ve unified one half of the continent – there’s only one path ahead of us now, and no going back. But you know that already, don’t you?\n\nGo forth, and make the world bleed."

 J84_4_2_suffer_no_interloper_desc: "“Taychend suffers no interloper.” The origin of the saying is unknown, with three dozen cities claiming their local god-hero was the first to say it. That only points to the prevalence of the sentiment – the destiny of Taychend is for the Taychendi alone to control. Laskaris the Conqueror intervened in our affairs when he launched his invasion – and then the city-state he ruled attempted to destroy our way of life. That cannot be allowed to stand – Ameion, as well as the two smaller cities that provided aid to their cause, must be seized, and the Kheionai must be taught a lesson they will not forget."

 J84_4_4_the_rhythm_of_war_title: "The Rhythm of War"
 J84_4_4_the_rhythm_of_war_desc: "There is little more glorious than war. The rush of battle, the elation of seeing the enemy rout before you, as the red-rays of the blooded sun of victory settle, and the vultures circle over a field of the dead. The dance of battle, and the rhythm of war. The Taychendi know it like no other – and they know that few others excel at it like they do.\n\nThey are so good at it, in fact, that enough competing military doctrines and ways of war have sprouted up over the years that one Taychendi army is often very different to another – if we are to claim our glory, however, we must march to the drum-beat we know best…"

 J84_4_5_titans_of_the_sea_title: "Titans of the Sea"
 J84_4_5_titans_of_the_sea_desc: "The seas may be terrifying to most Taychendi, but with experienced Kheionai sailors now being drawn from our Cleaved Sea territories, and the powerful Degárikes, as well as new designs of sail and mast, designed for the open ocean, Taychend has the opportunity to become a maritime power as well as a great land power – if the empire is to truly become the master of Andeios, it must learn to become the master of the waves."

 J84_4_7_the_depths_of_aercel_title: "The Depths of Aercel"
 J84_4_7_the_depths_of_aercel_desc: "Nanru Nakar, the city of cities! By all accounts, it is the greatest and largest Precursor city still standing – built over, as it has been, by over a millennium and a half of slums and temples and Taychendi-made monuments.\n\nBeneath its surface lies the Underground, a colossal labyrinth of slave warrens, storerooms, ancient laboratories and who knows what else. Its upper levels, the Undercity, is inhabited by the scum of Nanru Nakar – but the lower levels, the Underwarren, is filled with all manner of danger. Nobody knows how far the Underwarren goes – how deep the Slaver-Nobles delved. Why don’t we find out?"

 J84_4_8_the_riches_of_the_past_title: "The Riches of the Past"
 J84_4_8_the_riches_of_the_past_desc: "We have uncovered relic sites across Taychend, and uncover more by the day. Now that we have unearthed the secrets of the past, it is time to turn them into riches, and develop the infrastructure that will begin to shape our future!\n\nWhile we use those relics to fuel our burgeoning native artificery, there is another use for the surplus artefacts we dig up. The Cannorians will pay exorbitant sums for our goods – should you secure the trade networks around us, we will surely grow ever richer from their desires."

 J84_4_9_smoke_and_steel_title: "Smoke and Steel"
 J84_4_9_smoke_and_steel_desc: "The Vanbury Guild were a valued trading partner, despite the morally questionable character of their directors. When they sought to stand against us, however, we had no choice but to destroy them – now, we possess the heart of their former direct holdings.\n\nThe VG were halfway into turning Tor Nayyi into an industrial hellscape, an entire island of smoke and steel, processing the resource-profits of western Aelantir. You need to finish the Guild’s job."

But as we grow in power, whispers stir of a gathering storm on the steppe, as the minor tribes of the Chendhya seek to challenge our power, and preserve their freedom. There are various groups who would like to see that challenge be furiously answered – perhaps it is time their calls were answered?"

 J84_5_3_raiders_of_the_moon_title: "Raiders of the Moon"
 J84_5_3_raiders_of_the_moon_desc: "There are few who are as good at raiding as the descendants of Munakles, or Munazhlan as they call him. Mounted on their feline cavalry, or else armed with the powers to move rock and soil itself, they have fiercely defended their freedom over the years by military means – but as our soldiers finally sweep over their lands, it seems their efforts are gradually coming to naught. That does not mean they cannot be useful, however – the Chendhyans of the Guaraddhi already adopted our ways once. Perhaps their cousins on the far steppe, and in the Mteibas valley, can be convinced to do a similar thing."

 J84_5_4_monuments_of_the_water_title: "Monuments of the Water"
 J84_5_4_monuments_of_the_water_desc: "Though the Taychendi have never truly been at home on the sea, the storms of the southern seas warding off most from straying away from sight of land, greed and glory both have turned the Taychendi to the waves time and time again, as trade with the Kheionai brings wealth back to Taychend – and the power of their great ships occasionally make themselves known.\n\nAfter Laskaris invaded Taychend, there were once more efforts to unlock the secrets of Kheionai naval power – and in the Degárikes, monuments of the water, so great and powerful it is a glorious endeavour to build one in itself, the key was found. Devand will soon fall – but if we are to invade Alecand, we must build a fleet of these ships, and finally beat the Kheionai at their own game."

They eschewed worship of the gods in favour of mortal words and sayings, drinking their wine and carving their pretty statues. Our elites indulged in some of their ways, sure, importing Paraidar wine and Potidhano glass – but they never fell to their mindset. As they sat secure in their prison-cities, engaging in petty skirmishes and trade wars, we fought cataclysmic wars, storms of blood and fire. Laskaris thought he would bring their ways to us – instead, we will bring the storm to them, and show them what is truly the “superior” people."

They may not be superior, but it is difficult indeed to say they are not our near-equal, and that naturally means we must begin to treat them not as hostile enemies, but valuable subjects.\n\nThere is another option, though. A voice that says that today they are our near equal, and tomorrow they may prove they are more than that. A voice that says not to take the risk. Says to break them, once and for all… and to seize the hidden riches beneath their precious cities for our own gain. But we wouldn’t be so desperate to consume what we have so recently gained, ruin future territories, just to secure our power today, and gain temporary riches… would we?"

The acquisition of the Kheions and their knowledge, however, has given us a much clearer impression of Amadia, formed from the back of Oktikheion’s legendary Amadian Expedition.\n\nIt is a land of wild magic, fractured tribes, and silver and damestear beyond imagining.

On the millennial anniversary of the Ruin, Olhokar the Fortuitous had received a similar appeal – to grant the Brotherhood of the Bloody Cloak stewardship of the Chendhya.\n\nToday, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was flanked by two trusted warlords – Teshekar Takasangamar stood to one side, Andyzha Vakyrlana, of Darkalyndar, to the other. Teshekar leaned in first. “These elves are noble, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They guarded the frontier for centuries – even during Gophira’s fall, they upheld their sacred vows, never took sides! My family have sent many of our members to join their ranks – I know they’ll make good stewards, loyal and true.”\n\nAndzyha scoffed at that. “These Bloodcloaks are villains, renegades! Simply the worst people imaginable! They use their “vows” as excuses to terrorise innocent Chendhyans for fun – if “protecting the steppe” means riding around cutting tents, slaughtering livestock and whisking away women and children as slaves, then they “protect” very well indeed!”\n\n“Slander!” the Grandmaster called, as he rose to challenge Andyzha’s words. “We work only to protect Taychend from the Chendhyan hordes! For fun? You think we exact pleasure from our work?” When the warlord of Darkalyndar ostentatiously mouthed a “yes”, the Grandmaster drew the Greatsabre hanging on his back. “The steel of vengeance knows no pleasure, you barbarous, cat-riding whore–! I’ll have your–!”\n\n“Enough!” [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood suddenly, and the hall calmed at an instant. The Grandmaster shrunk back at the admonishment. “The Brotherhood’s appeal…”"
 taychendi_empire_events.1.db: "From Ebenanth Starshear’s Western Expedition, to the intervention of the Three Tribes in the Lanahine War, the pacification campaigns of the Mudaliar Empire, or Darakash Threadsworn’s stunning expedition through the steppe, Taychendi-Chendhyan history was as bloody as it was storied – and stagnant. Then, Ultarlan the Decimator arose.\n\nUltarlan united the Chendhyan tribes, and over the course of a decade conquered all Taychend. Though he was assassinated soon after, and his son Geladhlan – variously known as both “the Stoneburner” and “the Emancipator” – would fall victim to inter-tribal feuds, his empire collapsing with his death, the leftover Chendhyan kingdoms – Ezhudars – remained in power for decades. It would be these remnant kingdoms that would truly see Chendhyans adapt to Taychendi ways.\n\nBy the time Olhokar the Fortuitous rose and swept the remnant kingdoms away, a significant proportion of the Chendhyans in Taychend had adopted Taychendi religion, fighting wars for glory rather than simply defence. Most importantly, they had also adopted slavery – though they would never stoop so low as to enslave other Chendhyans, these “Chainforger” Chendhyans became active participants in the Andeiosian slave trade, selling Taychendi or Kheionai captives taken in raids to whoever would buy them.\n\nBe it the Ezhudar of Zaernmaera, who ravaged the Taychendi frontier in the early 1400s, Darkalyndar, who have served the Gophirans faithfully for centuries, or the Haebyziae tribe, who formed the backbone of Oremvand’s military, these Chainforger Chendhyans have proven themselves powerful and amenable to our ways time and time again. Perhaps we can cultivate this strength, and either give them more autonomy or sponsor the further adoption of Taychendi practices among their people?"

 taychendi_empire_events.2.d: "Alazhlan held tightly to the scruff of his feline mount’s dotted coat, as it deftly climbed the outcropping. When they had reached the pinnacle, he surveyed the army before him. Tens of thousands of Chendhyans had gathered on the plains, all for one purpose, all under his direction, and all for one reason. Alazhlan, Asadezheg of Saerraeg – the King of all Chendhyans – raised his sword towards the sky.\n\n“Chendhyans!” he called, and a roar unending answered, every mount and rider below crying out for freedom. “The slavers have united! A new empire of warlords has arisen – and they WILL seek to invade us! Destroy our way of life! Take our lives, our land, our freedom!” They always did – it was their nature, and had been from the days of the ancient Slaver-Nobles, and would be until the day they purged the vainglory from their hearts. That would not be this day, though – so instead, they would fight. “A hundred thousand elves and more march for the steppe – but will we stand by and watch as they subjugate us?”\n\nForty thousand elves answered in unison, their voices shaking the very earth – “Never!”\n\n“They are many, and we are few!” Alazhlan called. “But will we let that cower us?” “Never!” “Death awaits us! But will we let that break us!” “Never!” The Chendhyans raised their swords and spears towards the sky in defiance. “They want to buy our bodies with gold – but what will be our price?” “Blood! Blood! Blood!”\n\nAlazhlan beamed, even as the pit in his stomach deepened. He pointed his sword to the east – to Taychend, to death, to the end of everything they treasured. “Then ride with me, Chendhyans! Ride to war! Ride to vengeance! Ride to freedom!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.3.d: "As Seluslavi translated her owner’s words from Yodhanpir to Kalavendhi, Galinpan Kattyva threw his arms up in exasperation. “I’m not letting you have their city! I’m giving you half the population as slaves, their wealth, their livestock, even the warlord’s wife and children! What more could you want?” Seluslavi stole a glance at the aforementioned warlord on the other end of the table, staring straight ahead, despondent, while his overlord – the one supposed to be mediating – sold him out.\n\nThis was a Periyodhai – a semi-ritualised battle, with predetermined stakes, fought between two relatively equal vassals of a greater warlord. Everyone knew “Hurahara the Humungous” would win, though, so they were really negotiating his “prize”. She’d been the receiving end of one of these negotiations – the village star, a scholar destined for the Dumran Vustarvach. Now she was a slave, and she translated, and read her illiterate master stories, and provided him “comfort” when he demanded. And she longed for death, and never had the guts to seek it, and so Seluslavi translated.\n\nHurahara fumed, tried to control his rage for a second, then burst. “I WANT HIS CITY!” he boomed, as he slammed a fist down on the table so hard it nearly upended it. “I WANT HIS PEOPLE! I WANT THEM ALL!” The Kattyva didn’t need a translation to sigh in exasperation. It was easy to see what the Royakottari warlord desired. He had overextended himself in Yodhanchend looking for relics, and he wanted multiple reliable warlords to hold his lands there, not one ignorant brute called Hurahara the Humungous, whose neglect would ruin scavenging operations there for a generation.\n\nBut Hurahara was crazy, crazy, crazy, and he just didn’t care. The Kattyva finally gave in – and soon Seluslavi was translating that too. Hurahara seemed satisfied – Galinpan Kattyva silently counted up the costs of a military expedition. If the Kattyva won, she’d be sold off, taken by some saner lieutenant, maybe. Or she’d be killed when they took Hurahara’s home city. She’d like that. Tomorrow, she knew, the people in that warlord’s town would be wishing the exact same thing."

 taychendi_empire_events.4.da: "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] stepped into the Fateweaver’s chamber, he couldn’t help but be swallowed up by its majesty. The massive hall, carved deep into the hills, was bathed in the blue glow that emanated from the great damestear-jewel at its far end. Beneath it, at the apex of a pyramid of smooth-stone steps, hung the skeletal corpse of the Fateweaver – its arms outstretched and skull wrenched back, pierced with the relic-threads of prophecy, tendrils of ruin-steel that rose to the crystal above.\n\n“Beautiful, is it not?” the Threadbearer asked, as she walked up besides the Emperor. “We ought to go closer.” It took them a few minutes to reach the base of the stairs. Each step, Denariatam knew, was one taken by Darakash, Olhokar, Laskaris, countless conquerors and warlords and traders and politicians of ages past. They had each sought a glimpse of the future beneath the hills of Korrimutren – now, it was Denariatam’s turn.\n\nAs they reached the steps, the Threadbearer turned, motioned the Emperor to halt. “When I commune with the Fateweaver, I channel a power above any you could imagine. My own exceptional divination abilities are all that prevent a very gruesome death… do you know how to feel the future as I do?” Denariatam nodded, with the confidence only a powerful mage could muster. “Then step forth, and claim your destiny. I will wait here.”\n\nDenariatam ascended to the Fateweaver’s corpse. Her skeletal face was wrenched upwards – even worn to bone, he could see the agony of her final moments. The Emperor took a deep breath, closed his eyes, then placed his hand on the Precursor’s skull – immediately, unimaginable power surged through him. For a moment, he thought he had misjudged his strength, as the raw magics of an ancient being coursed through him, tore through his mind – then, his eyes snapped open, and he bore witness to a world beyond his own…"

 taychendi_empire_events.5.da: "Denariatam saw blurred images, snapping from one scene to the next. Armies marched through jungles, deserts, marshes, the Taychendi flag hoisted over cities of strange buildings – first some clearly Kheionai, then strange styles, with golden domes, smooth black spires, wooden cottages and honey-comb fortresses. Then back to Taychend – a scene on the Kalavend, blood soaked fields and broken bodies, with the Gathyanavaida tall in the background. A bolt from the astral whizzes through where it’s head would be, hurtling right towards the Emperor.\n\nDenariatam’s vision turned as if to run away – but a white-fanged shadow surprised him and pounced, its maw plunging him into darkness. The world was still for a moment – then there was a blinding burning light, a blazing sun rising and a sun-spot soldier within, wings sprouting from his back. He drew twin blades, and lunged.\n\nThe Emperor snapped awake from the communion with a start, staggering back. “Be careful…” the Threadbearer said, as her hand steadied him, “the first time is always difficult. What did you see?”\n\nDenariatam stared ahead at the Fateweaver’s corpse, frowning. “Strange new lands… and dangers in the dark. Blood and battle…” the corners of his lips crept upwards “...and glory. Strange new lands, and exotic new territories. Dangers from the dark, and dangers to be overcome.” Denariatam smiled."

In a heartbeat, everything suddenly stopped – the Threadbearer released her hand from the Fateweaver’s corpse, and the raw, rushing power of magic ceased, motes and wisps all that remained. After taking a moment to collect herself, she turned and descended the steppes silently, her face an unreadable mask.\n\n“So?” Denariatam asked tentatively. “What did you learn?” Was his empire to fall? Would he need to sacrifice his firstborn son? Would he be unkillable until he turned 61 years old? Or would he see unparalleled success? Glory and riches unrivalled?\n\nThe Threadbearer paused for a moment, her eyes moving to the sword at Denariatam’s hip. “Your armies will be uncountable, their advance unstoppable. Your empire will march to the ends of this world, conquer lands not yet seen by Elvenkind… but you will also fight enemies closer to home.” She looked up into the Emperor’s eyes. “Enemies await abroad – and daggers, of fanged teeth and shadow-shrouded steel, await you at home… waiting to strike, and waiting to take what they think is theirs.” The Threadbearer gave a little bow, her prophecy relayed, then began to walk back to the chamber.\n\n“Conquest, and steel, and daggers in the dark…” the Emperor said to himself, as he looked back to the great statue behind him.

 taychendi_empire_events.6.da: "Denariatam was “standing” in a city – the people strange, the buildings stranger. He saw black ships sail high above – and then to the east, the gilded storm on the ground. He recognised them as his own people – as Taychendi. The strangers around him turned to watch – then turned to flee. But the wave overcame them. The scene changed – the world burned, the world bled. Now, Denariatam saw the apocalypse, blurred but so vivid, so real.\n\nCorpses were piled high, the blood pooled up to their ankles, millions, desecrated and defiled. Wood and stone burned and broke apart. Then he saw another city destroyed, then another, then five and ten and twenty more. Then a parade of shackled slaves, a hundred abreast, that stretched for miles and miles – they were each brutalised, bloody, missing limbs, blinded and wailing and retching and groaning. Denariatam realised he was not alone, for besides the slaves a gilded Emperor stood watching – one with his own face. When a brilliant blue light arose and bathed the bloodied world in its warmth, slave and emperor both turned to watch.\n\nTacenie rose above the horizon. Bright, glorious. The last relic of the past. Then it fell.\n\nEven a disembodied voice, Denariatam felt the heat and the power and the pain. The sounds of tens of millions screaming at once in terror. His double merely watched on, even as the Ruin-come-again flayed the skin off his face. He looked so, so proud\n\nThe Emperor snapped awake from the communion with a start, staggering back. “My Emperor!” the Threadbearer pleaded, steadying his fall. “You looked in such pain– I thought you weren’t going to make it! You must tell me, what did you see?” Only now did Denariatam notice the fast-paced beating of his heart, the sweat that drenched his body, the lingering burning sensation on his skin. The Emperor wrenched himself from the Threadbearer’s hand, and turned to leave."
 taychendi_empire_events.6.db: "The communion was over in less than a minute. The rush of magic ceased in a heartbeat, as the Threadbearer released her hand from the Fateweaver’s corpse. The Threadbearer did not move – it took a moment for Denariatam to realise something was wrong, and hurry up the steps towards her. Sweat dripped down the Threadbearer’s brow, as she stared still ahead at the skull before her – her eyes wide with terror. When Denariatam tried to rouse her, she turned startled, recoiled from his touch and stumbled back, falling to the floor. “What happened?” Denariatam asked. “What did you see!?”\n\nHer voice was tinged with horror. “Death! Death and terror and ruin! So much destruction, so much– by the gods, the blood! The screams–!”\nA chill went up Denariatam’s spine. “What did you see, oracle!? Whose blood, whose screams?!”\n“The world’s!” The Threadbearer cried. “My Emperor, the world’s! I saw men, women, children, thrown onto the pyres of their burning cities… hacked apart by sabre and shot, flayed alive by mage-fire! Black ships sailed, bays of chains and chattle, wailing, groaning– Taychendi, Kheionai, scaled monsters and green-hided brutes, whatever, whoever, it didn’t matter! The world weeping blood– by the gods, the crimes… the terrible crimes!” The Threadbearer threw her hands over her face to hide her tears.\n\n“Gods…” Denariatam muttered, “why must you toy with us so?” He stepped back, turned to the jewel above. Rage and terror mixed in his heart. “Damnable fate! You give us portents but no prophecy! WHAT MUST WE DO!?”\n“Tacenie…” the Threadbearer whispered. Denariatam’s head snapped back – the Threadbearer’s arms fell limply by her side. She looked off into the distance. “I saw Tacenie, rising above.” Then turned towards her Emperor. “And then it fell, and the flame of Ruin shattered the world. And you were watching, staring…"

 taychendi_empire_events.7.da: "Denariatam saw blurred images, visions, snapping from one scene to the next. Mages and tinkerers, most Taychendi but some strange, short or scaled, worked in laboratories, unearthed underground chambers, artefacts. He saw a kotakompu being pulled apart and reassembled in steel – the tortured beast noticed him and pounced. Then all dark – and the pulse of beating blood and whirring, crackling mana surged around him. Then the darkness cracked, and with the tearing of flesh and the whirring of steel, the walls of red-iron tore away – and a monster, a beast bigger than any the Emperor had ever seen before, revealed itself. It rose through the storm, reality warping around it’s immensity, incomprehension digging into Denariatam’s soul.\n\nThe Emperor snapped awake from the communion with a start, staggering back. “Be careful…” the Threadbearer said, as her hand steadied him, “the first time is always difficult. What did you see?”\n\nDenariatam wanted to say that he didn’t know. That he hadn’t the faintest idea. That the world was upside down and left was right. Then he took a deep breath, got a grip, and simply said whatever came to mind. “I suppose… I saw mechanical hearts and grinding gears, chambers reliquary and valves mechanical. I saw Taychend pulse with the damestear-blood of magic, the world torn apart by the ambition of… of…”\n\nDenariatam felt a presence behind him – though even as he turned, he knew there was nothing there.

And with mechanical hearts within, and the sound of grinding gears behind…?” The Threadbearer looked away from Denariatam – past him, as if whatever she had seen in the prophecy was behind the Emperor. “You will confront forces that will stretch comprehension itself.”\n\nThe Threadbearer shook her head as if to clear it, then turned back to Denariatam. “I am sorry, the communion was tiring… please, leave whenever you see fit.” Then she hurried off, and the Emperor was left alone – the past glowing bright before him, and the future towering high behind him."

Their town had won a series of Periyodhai recently, their warriors besting all the neighbouring city-states – Gadivelgar and Ulmukilavand and Denvephirsi. And while they won glory, he’d been stuck at home, jewelling. Camnan looked down to his withered legs – and the wheeled chair that held them.\n\nThe jeweller heard a loud tut from behind him. “Each parade, I find you in such a state. Must you wallow in regret like so?” Camnan turned – Jalinwathi, the local priest of Elajith, and a member of the Violet Brotherhood, stood, arms crossed and a faint smile across his face.\n\nCamnan shrugged, frowning. “My friends win glory on the battlefield day by day – why, Varanran has slain so many foes he may well ascend! Meanwhile I’m stuck here… tinkering!” The jeweller looked to the parade again. “How am I supposed to attain glory if I can’t fight?”\n\n“The same way your sister’s writing grants glory, or old Trianran’s smithing – why, that elf made half the weapons used in that battle! You make wonders every month, and you still feel inadequate? Foolishness, Camnan, foolishness– there are many paths to ascension! And in Dhivumanhu, smith and soldier both drink from the same Pheni barrel!”\n\nCamnan scoffed. “Then why do we love war and battle so? The Empire marches east and west, north and south– how could you get more glorious than that?”\n\nNow it was Jalinwathi’s turn to frown. “Elvenkind has always craved the easy path. And blood and violence is easy… but sometimes it is being turned from the easy that allows one to seek the fulfilling.” The priest looked to the parade. “Perhaps Taychend will turn from the easy path one day…”"

The blue glow of magic erupted from the steel casing. The harsh glow turned his eyes to the sky above – and send a wave of unease rippling through him. Denariatam turned to the woman standing to his side, furiously scribbling in her notebook.\n\n“Are you certain we are safe, here?” Denariatam asked. “With the Windward gone– what if a storm strikes?”\n“We are safe,” Lelijitha Vustarin bluntly stated, not caring to look up from her notes. “We’ve done evacuation drills fifteen times… no, sixteen. Any residents will die, but our labourers will be safely in Ormam before any disaster strikes.”\nThe Emperor shook his head, as he turned back to the excavation. “Riches for us, fear for them, but it is ill-delivered – Degakheion was a proud city of glorious warriors. I should have chosen Oktikheion.”\n“And why did I counsel you otherwise?”\nDenariatam frowned. “Yes, yes, I know… my compunctions are exactly why it needed to be targeted. I see that, but even so…”\n\nThe Vustarin Matriarch finally looked up from her notebook. “The old Kheionai used to be mere prisoners of Tacenie, by my estimation. The Phylaxana were the last of their wardens. They clung to a long obsolete duty, a relic of the last cycle, just like – and forgive the slander – the Mudaliars. Unlike the Mudaliars, though, they used their ancestry to justify mocking the ways of all those opposed to them, even other Kheionai, like the Karkares they kept under “watch”. They never would have accepted our ways, and so they needed to serve as an example. Degakheion will remain forever a tombstone for Kheionai exceptionalism. A sign that our might, our fury, is more than equal to their “sophistication.”"

A short fellow in a funny hat, “Sando Brassbottle”, led him around, as his assistants gave demonstrations of each invention. “Here– T-Wave transmitters, connects like lightning– oh, and speaking of lightning– sparkdrives! Any enemies? Bad doud? Pull the trigger and… toddo! Dead! And here... hmm, the “Maagikraftfayermaszeene”- thaumaturgical arcano-blaster cannon, yes? Supercharged a little, modified by me– it is… ah, not yet perfect, yes? Will backfire, mmm… 49.5% of the time? Needs a bit more “geelder” to fix, if you understand.”\n\nThe Emperor understood perfectly. The other weapons and inventions interested him, and greatly – but they were single-target weapons. He wanted devastation, and this arcane blaster thing looked like it could give him it. Denariatam pointed to the statue in the distance – and the palace where its head once stood. “Ebenanth, the First Emperor, decapitated that statue with a bolt from the Astral Sky. Precise annihilation – give me that, and I’ll give you more gold than you can imagine.”\n\nSando understood the assignment. He scratched his beard as he contemplated. “That… is difficult, yes… very difficult.” He called on his assistants, and they set to work modifying the canon, tinkering with the casing and the damestear within, aligning it perfectly – then, the gnome hooked up a string to a lever at the cannon’s back, and ordered those present to stand no less than 6.1 metres away. After a short countdown, Boltbrass pulled on the string and shouted “Danger-ho!”\n\nThe back of the blaster exploded. Half the artificers ducked for cover – but the Emperor was too transfixed on the magical bolt careening through the sky to care. It impacted the palace atop the Gathyanavaida and blew half of it into the sky. Denariatam’s breath caught – the power of Ebenanth replicated before his eyes. If this was the power of but a few Cannorian artificers, what could the Taychendi do with this technology?"

 taychendi_empire_events.12.d: "After the wars of the Relic-Lord Kadradar, who unleashed a devastating plague on Andeios, fuelled by fell blood magics that turned elven disease immunity against itself, many Taychendi sought an escape from the chaos of their homeland. It was off the back of a Fateweaver-given prophecy that Darakash Threadsworn set off to the west, establishing a Taychendi “philosopher-kingdom” near Empkeios called Vadhipakvam, where he attempted to integrate Kheionai-inspired thinking into a Taychendi way of viewing the world.\n\nDarakash never truly fulfilled his dreams, however. His expedition had left carnage in its wake, and the incensed Chendhyans rallied against this new invader – not twenty years after its founding, Ultarlan the Decimator destroyed Vadhipakvam. Few Taychendi survived – none made it back home.\n\nBut times have changed. The Chendhya is pacified for good, and we now control the entirety of a land synonymous with philosophical thinking.

 taychendi_empire_events.13.d: "“Can we do it? Well…” a slave passed the Vustarin a series of papers – she rolled them out on the desk, revealing a series of city plans. “The location or supposed location of the Zopedan cores in each of the Kheions – we did a little investigating before Degakheion was agreed upon, just in case, but now that we know what they look like, how you can scrap your way to finding them…? Well, Arpedifér’s core is the only one that still eludes us, but we’ll get there – other than that only problem comes in clearing out the areas we need to excavate.”\n\nDenariatam nodded as he stared at the papers on the meeting table. The moment he laid his eyes on the final figures from the excavation of Degakheion’s windward, his mind was set. The wealth they had dug up from those cities was simply astronomical… how could he resist the opportunity to replicate that success six times over?\n\n“My Emperor?” Denariatam looked up. “I think you’re asking the wrong questions.” The Vustarin Matriarch put Oktikheion’s city-plan to one side, and unravelled a map of the Cleaved Sea. “It isn’t whether we’ve prepared to excavate – it’s if you’ve prepared for what comes next. The Kheionai will rise in revolt… and if I had to guess, it would all Kheionai, everywhere. And the world will look on us like– well, we’d be pariahs for a time, I’m sure.”\n\nThe Emperor furrowed his brow. “I didn’t expect you to question my morality.”\n\n“Not your morality,” the Vustarin pointed at Empkeios on the map, “your troop deployments. Threzaranthi Uyasmar would do more good in Oktikheion than Empkeios, and the Rakulacans… well, let’s just say this is going to take a lot of bloodshed, and they’ve proved good at it.”"

Now, the once mighty centres of Kheionai civilisation lie desolate, now more tombstone than city.\n\nWhen one asks if it was worth it, when one asks if we can lie easy, having destroyed the heart of a civilisation, we may simply point to the mountains of damestear and Precursor-steel dragged up from their depths – worth enough to launch a thousand ships or outfit a hundred-thousand soldiers.\n\nThe Kheions survived the Ruin of Aelantir, survived the withering storm of the Kaydhano, survived strife and war, Kheionai against Kheionai – but they could not withstand our ambition, our pride, our vainglory.

Were we able to control this process, we could have a tighter grip on Taychendi religion than anyone has ever known. The gates of Dhivumanhu would be ours to control.\n\nThey are also unravellers by nature, and the field of magic and extraplanar research is one they have spent considerable effort unwinding. Were we to either convert, or accept the church into our lands, we may be able to gain access to this knowledge.\n\nThere is one problem, of course – slavery. The Ravelians do not favour the practice.

But Effelai wood can burn as well as any other, and if we are to push north, and claim the entirety of southern Aelantir for ourselves, then we must set many, many fires indeed.\n\nBut that is easier said than done. The northern jungle has many resources at its disposal, with monstrous fauna and vine-slave Seedthralls proving themselves more than a match for our regular soldiers – and to make matters worse, the Effelai has made a nasty habit of turning our dead into their puppets.\n\nWe have a solution to our plight, though – artificery. Our innovation knows no bound, and with our tinkerers and engineers crafting every manner of war machine, so too will our capacity for destruction. The only question is to what extent shall we unleash this new technology? What is more glorious, truly – to let loose the very fires of Cerachmanu, and the storms of the Uyava-Nadhru, on a nightmare beyond comprehension? Or, perhaps, to take it on by your own flesh and blood?"

Ahead of her was whatever remained of her family and friends – behind her was death. Her village had already been consumed, incinerated by the iron-masked elves and their jets of flame. If not for Ishere’s quick thinking, Eestra would have been consumed as well.\n\nBut the fire wasn’t all she needed to worry about. A bull-like beast charged from the darkness, sent by the jungle maybe, straight at the wall of fire. One second Ishere was running for her life – the next she flying through the air. A snap cut her cry short. Eestra screamed, sprinted over to her sister, turned her over. She ignored the lifeless look in her eyes, tried to shake her awake anyway. Then nothing, and she screamed again, and she hugged her sister’s corpse tight to her chest, and began to wail. Her next scream was one of pain, not grief, as the fire claimed her, and her skin crackled and boiled, and every nerve in her body was set alight and torn apart.\n\n– – –  \n\nUnatam tried to hold the Auto-Scorchray level, as he wrested with the cord that tied it to a Damestear core behind him. Each step was deliberate, in time with the heat-masked elves to his left and right – so long as they kept the formation, the Effelai’s beasts couldn’t make it past them. He was concentrating, focused – then, he saw something emerge from the wall of fire.\n\nAt first he thought it was a scorched tree stump – but as he marched forwards, unable to take his eyes off it, he began to understand what it was. A Effelai native holding another in her arms. Mother and daughter, maybe, now charred bone and blackened flesh. For a heartbeat Unatam felt shame – then he replaced it with rage. He did not stop to think who he was raging against."

Once, Olhokar the Fortuitous had held a great festival here, to mark the thousand-year anniversary of the Ruin – every warlord worth anything gathered here, with their retinues and their families. And now, they gathered once more.\n\nThey lined up here to kneel before him – to prostrate themselves before the Emperor and proclaim their loyalty, shower him with gifts – and when they died, their heirs would come to kneel as well, and their heirs after them. It was an ingenious system, one that forced each major warlord of the realm to bow to the Imperial power, one that reminded them of their true place in the world.\n\nThe Tailatam System, it was called. Amidst the death throes of the Second Gophiran Empire, its progenitor, Tailatam Sangamar, had employed it to great effect in the lands he controlled, binding the warlords of the Kalavend to him while he turned his attention to winning the civil war. It didn’t save Tailatam in the end, as assassins of the Na’Cailana slaughtered his advisors and generals, and left his movement in the dirt – but the Taialtam System signified the final form of Gophira’s hegemonic aspirations. The final step in their plan to make their rule over Taychend eternal.\n\nDenariatam Rakulacan would fulfil that plan. Here, they would kneel – and out there, they would obey. The warlords had enough power already, over his actions, over the Empire’s future, but he would not allow them to control the Emperor’s future – and he would not allow those who rejected that right to persist into the future either. He noted the tens of thousands there – and felt the hundreds not. But they would be crushed, in due time. And their replacements, like the rest of the warlords, and the rest of the world, would be forced to kneel."

 taychendi_empire_events.19.d: "Sabre struck sabre, and the crowd roared at every clash. It was more a dance than a duel, as Tesharanthi Takasangamar and Elvaratam Sharadan threw everything they had at each other. Both were masters of the sabre, but while Elvaratam wielded twin blades whirlwind-like, Tesharanthi’s true power was the technicolour cape on his shoulder, enchanted to high heaven and nearly impervious to attack. Tesharanthi wielded it half a buckler, half a matador’s cloak, its defensive value only improving his aggression. Absolute offence vs perfect offensive-defence – no wonder a hundred thousand Taychendi had turned out to watch.\n\nThe Emperor couldn’t help but be enraptured himself – but he wasn’t just taken in by the duel. This fight was the culmination of decades of political feuding between Kattisangamar and Sibisimra. The feud between Elvaratam and Tesharanthi had begun to draw in other warlords – so Emperor Denariatam decided to bring it to its conclusion. Now, in the heart of the Mavihanavao, the core of Nanru Nakar’s martial legacy, the two feuding warlords could finally fight it out.\n\nThe crowd grew wilder as the fight progressed – as Elvaratam tired against Tesharanthi’s peerless defence. Denariatam could see the Mudaliar Cousins on the other side of the box excitedly discuss the battle below. It was their family’s ancestor who had inspired this. As the first Mudaliar Emperor had once said, “it is not the Emperor’s duty to impede the glory of their subjects, and it is not their duty to stand by. It is their duty to channel, to uplift – to sit up on the High Chair, and make themselves violence’s protector, and vainglory’s pride.”\n\nThe Takasangamar made a mistake – a small slip, a miss, and the exhausted Elvaratam pounced like the bandit he was. There was a tornado of steel, and in a heartbeat Tesharanthi was at his opponent’s mercy. The crowd erupted, even as the Emperor rose to proclaim the outcome."

To win this fight, we must burn the Effelai to the ground.\n\nLuckily, we are not like those who have tried before. The O’onoi were few in number – but we are numerous. The Exemplars were held back by their moral code – but we will go to any length to win. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers, armed with torch and sabre and Auto-Scorchray alike, stand ready to march north, and claim millions of miles of new land for the Empire of Taychend.\n\nThe Effelai knows this. The jungle’s piercing screams split the land, as its wailing song turns the living and dead into our enemies. As hundreds of thousands of our soldiers pour north, a hundred thousand Lai’i and Parura and Effei and Seedthralls stand ready to meet us.\n\nThe Effelai fears us. Let’s show it why it’s right to!"

 taychendi_empire_events.21.d: "Denariatam looked across the landscape in disbelief as he wandered aimlessly. The warlords at his side were telling him something, but the words went in one ear and out the other. He had been at the forefront of the conflict, at the wall of flame that had put the Effelai to flight – and then slain it. For months, the Emperor had lived in a world of smoke-choked skies and roaring fires, bloodied vines and mud-soaked steel. The war against the Effelai was fought in darkness – but now, he saw its aftermath in the light of day.\n\nBefore the war, the Effelai had been a forest of tall canopies, webs of vine and silk and exotic plants and flowers, the green of the leaves fighting with red and pink and blue for dominance. Now, the ground was covered in a field of light grey, ash carpeting the soil like snow. And with the towering trees that had once blocked sun and sight gone, replaced with twisted, charred, hulking husks, it was if the whole of the Effelai was laid out before him. A forest of blackened stumps, each a tombstone to the singing jungle, that went on for miles and miles and miles.\n\nSomething caught the Emperor’s eye – Denariatam halted, looked down at his feet. A green shoot sprouted through the ash. “The Effelai…” Denariatam asked, a chill running down his spine. “It’s gone? Completely?”\n\nThe warlord to his side raised an eyebrow. “My Emperor… that’s what I was telling you about, sir.” Denariatam just stared at him blankly – the warlord started again. “We believe it has been crippled. The Seedthralls are all gone, any above ground presence has been incinerated… but some of the roots near the Heart are still alive. We’ve been burning them when we can, but…”\n\nDenariatam laughed. All this, and it still persisted! They had burned the world, burned half the continent, and it still survived! The Emperor shook his head. “No, no– we’ve had enough burning. If you find any remnants, separate them, collect them – keep them alive. We may have defeated the Effelai…”"

The song of the jungle mix with the screams of the dying. Everywhere, elves ask “why?”\n\nSome also ask “how?” They lay the blame at the Emperor Denariatam’s feet, and accuse him of having blood on his hands and ash on his boots. Many of the warlords agree.\n\nBut that cannot be allowed to persist. Taychend has been beaten before – but we will not allow our Northern Expedition to become Ebenanth’s Western Expedition. This will not be our downfall, merely a setback in Taychend’s ultimate destiny.\n\nThe war drums beat once more, the sabres are sharpened, the fire is reignited. Today, the Effelai is victorious – tomorrow, it shall learn just how temporary that victory is."

I’LL DRAG THEM TO THE INFERNAL PLANES MYSELF–! I’LL SKEWER THEM AND WATCH THEM COOK! YOU HEAR ME?! THEY’LL BURN– BUURRRRNNNN–!”\n\nThe lead engineer – one Galinpan Arihnai – gave a hearty laugh at the captive’s threat. “As you can see, the demon gets rather angry stuck in there.” The lead engineer stepped towards the turret’s “nozzle”, making sure to keep his head out of the way. “In fact, that is the secret to our system here, my Emperor – a jet of flame, available on demand! Allow me to demonstrate.” One of Galinpan’s assistant artificers handed him a heavy, padded cowl – after he put it on, the lead engineer moved his head before the nozzle for a split second.\n\n“BUURRRRNNN–!” came the cry, and then a roaring jet of flame erupted from within. The top of Galinpan’s cowl singed, but the artificer came away otherwise unscathed. The lead engineer walked back to the Emperor – and motioned for one of his companions to get a preprepared hunk of meat. Denariatam couldn’t help but be impressed by the display – infernal fire was as powerful as the stories said.\n\n“Using some of those documents the Ravelians generously donated, we managed to organise a very successful capture operation. After that, it was just a manner of…” Galinpan looked back to the metal turret – the demon’s prison. “...Conditioning. Yes, conditioning. Peeking our heads near the nozzle gets a guaranteed reaction, but we’re working on some additional trigger-points.” The lead engineer turned around, and signalled to his assistant, who very carefully dangled the hunk of meat in front of the nozzle.\n\nThere was a moment of nothing – then, a jet of flame flash-cooked the steak. Galinpan turned to the Emperor as the assistant made ready to throw the steak in – and was then cut off as a much fiercer jet of flame incinerated steak and hand alike. Galinpan and the Emperor both grimaced as the assistant screamed in pain."

 taychendi_empire_events.24.d: "The door to the throne room shattered – a moment passed, then Daranarma’s warriors, armed with all manner of scrap-artificer weapons and military gizmos, charged into the room. They were not met with any resistance. Jalinta knew his fate was sealed the moment he lost the Periyodhai – he’d made sure he would face his enemy alone. He grimaced as that enemy walked through the broken door, wielding a massive handheld cannon. The Techno-Warlord pointed it as Sajirada.\n\n“How lucky I am,” Daranarma started, “that you were not killed on the field yesterday! I’ve gotten a lot more testing out of my new weapon!” He had a satisfied grin on his face that made Sajirada’s blood boil. “This–” he turned his cannon to show the rainbow-like crystal that powered it, “-is prismatic damestear, straight from Amadia!” He had heard of these things – powerful but wild, chaotic. ”It packs a punch, my friend– want to see!?”\n\nThe Techno-Warlord levelled the cannon at the seated warlord – as the barrel began to glow with prismatic light, Sajirada readied himself for the end. But when the weapon fired, it was not Sajirada who was claimed by it. An explosion of prismatic light erupted from the back of the weapon – and the right half of Daranarma’s upper body exploded with it. The Techno-Warlord flew through the air, alongside a shower of giblets and gore. His mutilated corpse hit the floor with a wet thump.\n\nDaranarma’s men looked at the corpse, then at each other, and then broke, fleeing. Sajirada could hardly believe his luck. He climbed down from the throne and walked over to the weapon that had both doomed and then saved him, picking it up. Suddenly, an idea came to mind. The weapon packed a punch, but was dangerous to whoever wielded it… so what if whoever wielded it didn’t matter?"

As far as we understand, the Effelai used the same processes it employed to encourage the growth of its plants and roots to encourage the growth of its animate creations.” The artificer gestured to the elf in the testing chamber, seemingly sedated. “By taking those processes and introducing them to our own subjects, we believe we can replicate the Effelai’s… creative abilities.” An assistant entered the testing chamber, jabbed some sort of needle in the ruinborn’s neck, then rushed back out. The door slammed behind him.\n\n“We’ve tried it on plants, kotakompu, oxes.” The ruinborn jerked awake – then began to writhe around in pain. “All trials were… highly effective.” There were gasps in the observation chamber as tumours seemed to sprout across the subject’s body, his muscles bulging, expanding. Muffled screams could be heard from behind the iron-barred glass, as cords of muscle sprouted from the elf’s body – red at first, though they quickly turned green. Flowers sprouted from the vine-like tendons. “Muscle growth was particularly exceptional.”\n\n“He does not seem controllable,” the Emperor commented, as the test subject slammed his head against the ground repeatedly. Blood and bone splattered across the chamber floor.\n\n“Oh, “he” will expire soon,” the artificer admitted, “the real issue is controlling the subject’s corpse. As with the growth serum, we needed to rely on the Effelai’s own methods.” He turned to one of his assistants and gave a command – soon, a siren-like song could be heard from beyond the glass. The ruinborn snapped out of his frenzy immediately, even as his body continued to tear itself apart – as the song changed, he stood, swaying to the rhythm.\n\nOne of the warlords in the room turned to the Emperor, horror written across his face. “To subject living beings to this monstrosity is– it’s an insult to all who died fighting the Effelai! We fought to destroy that thing, not revive it! How could you–” The Emperor cut him off with a glare."

Both of those assumptions, it seems, were misguided.\n\nThe Effelai was complex beyond imagining, its true nature likely known only to those who had created it – or, at least, observed it in its initial stages. With the Effelai defeated in its home territory, cut down to a few scraps clinging to its heart, we thought we could harness its near-corpse, and effectively lifted the methods it had used to expand wholesale. Unfortunately, we seem to neglected just how much of the old singing jungle we would be bringing forwards.\n\nAcross our empire, it seems that the various Effelai-influenced plants and Seedthralls have been taken back under the control of the remnant Heart, and are now going berserk, with plants rapidly spreading and consuming farmers and villagers alike, and our imitation Seedthralls rampaging across the land. While we have desperately tightened the security around the Heart of the Effelai so that this does not happen again, we will still have to clean up the out of control plants."

The fight had taken everything both of them had, as sabre, shield and warhammer clashed, an audience of tens of thousands of Ozgar Orcs and Taychendi watching on. The Emperor himself felt half-dead, bones cracked and blood and sweat mixing as they dripped down his face – but even still, it was his sabre that was aimed at the orcish chieftain’s neck. Denariatam had won.\n\nThe chieftain looked up, straight into the Emperor’s eyes. “You bested me… a good fight, but you bested me…” the orc smiled despite himself – they had given both their peoples a show they would not soon forget. “Congratulations… chieftain.” The smile wore away as the Taychendi in attendance cheered, and the orcish now-ex-chieftain understood exactly what he had lost. This was an Ozarm Chadash – and now, Emperor Denariatam found himself the undisputed master of all orcs in his realm. The Taychendi elf took his sword away, and turned to the crowd.\n\nThe orcs had looks of existential fear written on their faces. Their existence hinged on his decision now. Many of the warlords wanted to “repossess” the orcs – apparently created by Ducaniel, the scion of Aesadas, so recently rediscovered but already regarded with a mix of awe and derision. Some of those wanted to put them to work in the mines and plantations, as the Cannorians had done – but was that not a waste of their martial abilities? Others wanted to induct them into a specialised force of auxiliaries, send them as shock troops against our enemies. There were those still that wanted to simply leave them alone. Had they not suffered enough?\n\nDenariatam supposed he was the judge of that, now. He called to the crowd – “Orcs of Taychend…”"

The corpses of his soldiers were strewn about, mutilated, ripped apart, smashed in. Blood pooled across the floor, spattered the walls. It was like some terrible beast had rampaged through – and had left a horrific trail of death and devastation in their wake, that continued all the way through the Sajirada base. They’d done well for themselves since their late patriarch Jalinta had turned them into feared Techno-Warlords, expanding their territory, their influence, their manpower. Now, something had turned all that inside out – hundreds had been killed, and seemingly without any casualties.\n\nFinally, Sajirada and his men came to his throne room. The trail of blood and gore led right up to the golden chair at it’s head, the twenty corpses that surrounded it – and the armoured figure that sat atop it. The armoured elf was seven feet tall, covered head to toe in jagged Precursor-steel plates, Damestear glowing beneath them. The hulking figure stood up, and cracked its knuckles.\n\nThe Techno-Warlord ordered his soldiers forwards – and then watched in horror as they were torn apart. Gunfire, sabre slashes, magic bolts, all had no effect. The steel plates, already coated in gore, were painted a deeper red. Finally, only Sajirada was left. The armoured figure advanced, swiped the warlord’s weapon away, and threw him to the floor. It stood over him – then the figure removed their helmet.\n\nThe warlord stared in disbelief. Towering over him was the face of Selurana Vustarin – the fifty-something, bookish matriarch of the Vustarin family had torn through an entire army. “That’s impossible! What is this– this power!?”\n\n“I believe,” the Vustarin gloated as she readied the killing blow, “this is the power of Yodhan!

His empire would conquer, and the warlords would hunger, and on the blood of the world they would feed, the ichor of their ascension.\n\nThe cart of empire was running, running… faster yet faster, straight ahead, destined for the wall named “ETERNITY” – the true end of the Cycle of Glory. The beginning of a new age, where Taychend would rule undisputed. It was unstoppable. It was uncontrollable. And if they looked beyond the wall and did not like what they saw? Or if the wheels were running off fate’s track, towards somewhere nobody could even comprehend?\n\nWell, there was Deniaratam could do about it anymore. He took another sip from his wine, closed his eyes. The hum of Empire, and the screams of the conquered, and the cry of “glory! Glory! Glory!” droned on – as it did, as it had, as it would. Already, his lieutenants were drawing up plans for new expeditions, to North Aelantir, to Insyaa, to Sarhal. The Emperor knew his realm would go further. An empire for a day, an empire for an eon, it did not matter – Taychend will rise, an Empire Unstoppable, an Empire Ascendant, an Empire Vainglorious…"
 taychendi_empire_events.29.aa: "…and the gaping maw of pride shall swallow the world."
 taychendi_empire_events.29.devil: "Denariatam took another sip of wine as he looked out from his balcony, at the immensity of his capital below. It was night, but even now the light of commerce, industry and empire illuminated the light’s sky. Taychend never truly slept anymore. The carts never stopped, the harvest never ended, the war-banners never unfurled.\n\nThe Emperor closed his eyes – and in his mind he saw images of conquest, of glory. The sounds of battle, steel clashing, flesh rending, warriors calling battle cries as the gore-covered and yet-still-glorious fallen cried for mother or mercy or malevolence’s brand of justice. And the blood… all the blood. Even as he mused on the realm he ruled, his subordinates arranged new campaigns in North Aelantir, in Sarhal, in Insyaa. From the warlord to the warrior to the wretched slave, Taychend hungered – and it satiated itself on the blood of the world.\n\nDenariatam downed his wine-cup – savoured the purple-red trickling down his throat. Why did blood satiate Taychend? Why had the other empires not realised this, not conquered the world to sustain themselves? He used to ask these questions. Then, like Valkadevu on the wastes of Neraghul, he understood. The other empires had simply misunderstood – glory is not some ambiguous thing. Glory is Violence.\n\nIf the Emperor would not kill, end, conquer, annihilate then the warlords would do it for them. And so you be the sword, or face it. And so Taychend would march, and destroy, and drink the blood of the unconquered world until they could drink no more. Then? Maybe they’d all turn on each other, rend the Empire apart for the ichor of ascension that pumped through its veins. It didn’t matter. The Cycle of Glory – the Cycle of Blood – would be over, and Taychend would have already ascended. An Empire of Violence, and an Empire Vainglorious..."
 taychendi_empire_events.29.aevil: "…and the heartbeat-drum of wrath shall beat to the end of the world."
 taychendi_empire_events.29.dvampire: "Mihaela wonders through her museum, looking at all the relics and artefacts she’s looted from the enemies of Taychend. Kamrayakval’s Armour, Laskaris’ helmet, the seal of the VG, an Erythe mist generator from Degakheion, Theodore’s rapier (generously donated), a prismatic idol from Amadia, and the preserved body of a seedthrall. She goes “yeah I’m gonna rule the world, Umbral King should’ve done this instead” and decides that she very much likes being an Empress."
 taychendi_empire_events.29.avampire: "Option1"
 taychendi_empire_events.29.dlarankar: "Denariatam looked at the armour before him – plates of precursor steel covered mail, elegant and imposing all at once. It was the armour of Erankar, the armour that the Emperor-Defiant had worn as he cleaved Fate’s puppet-strings, and carved an Empire from anarchy. Since then, Larankar had given Taychend victory after victory, the borders expanding beyond any previous Taychendi realm. He should be happy – but Denariatam could only grimace as he thought about the empire he ruled, as the so-called “Warlord-Autonomous.” \n\nDenariatam knew now that his dynasty would not fall as the others did. His empire would conquer, and the warlords would hunger, and on the blood of the world they would feed, the ichor of their ascension. The cart of empire moved faster yet faster, straight ahead, destined for the beginning of a new cycle, where Taychend would rule undisputed. It was unstoppable. It was uncontrollable. And if he looked beyond this cycle and did not like what he saw? Or if the wheels were running off imagining’s track, towards somewhere he could not comprehend?\n\nDeniaratam professed total autonomy – he wanted to believe Erankar had cut fate’s cord long ago. But he knew that no matter what he did, the hum of Empire and conquest and glory would drone on – as it did, as it had, as it would. Already, his lieutenants were drawing up plans for new expeditions, to North Aelantir, to Insyaa, to Sarhal. He desired these things – but could he afford not to? Or was he a slave, destined to be but a cog in a machine with one destination? The conquest of the world – then disaster?\n\nHe could only see one answer, and it weighed on him far heavier than Ruin-steel. An empire for a day, an empire for an eon, it did not matter – Taychend would rise, an Empire Unstoppable, an Empire Ascendant, an Empire Vainglorious…"
 taychendi_empire_events.29.alarankar: "…and there was nothing Denariatam could do to stop it."
 taychendi_empire_events.29.dgophira: "The Sangamar King smiled as he looked out over the desert. He was standing where Olhokar had once sacrificed his eldest son to save Gophira. He had not known how successful he was – for in saving Gophira, he had saved first the greatest empire of Taychend, and then the greatest empire since the Precursors.\n\nThe Gophiran Empire now stretched from the cities of the Triarchy to the coast of Soruin, from the sand-blasted wastes of Alecand to the plains of the Dry Coast. Taychend had far surpassed the heights of prosperity they reached under the Second Empire. The Ironblood Army was so large as to be uncountable, so powerful as to be undefeatable. By subsuming the warlords, and then unleashing them on the world, the Sangamars had seemingly dominated them. While its borders and buildings expanded, the Third Gophiran Empire was unstoppable.\n\nBut Denariatam knew that blood was like poison to metal – and bloodlust could be poison to his empire. There was a point, halfway through the Second Empire, that it seemed nothing could stop the turning of the Cycle, Gophira’s final victory. Then, Gophira proved that it could stop that victory all by itself. The Second Empire collapsed into a death-spiral of civil war. When the Third Empire’s borders could expand no further, would Gophira’s army then turn inwards for a new source of glory?\n\nThe Emperor sighed. He supposed that was a question for his descendants – for now, it was all he could do to make sure Gophira did not falter, that it would rise, an Empire of Iron, an Empire Eternal…"
 taychendi_empire_events.29.agophira: "…and an Empire Vainglorious"
 taychendi_empire_events.29.dsthanan: "Denariatam stared emptily at the wine-cup on his desk – he sighed, then downed its contents. The entire day he had been locked inside his study in the Violet Library, pouring over old histories, thinking and thinking. He had read of the old empires of Taychend, of the first Dumrusvarn – and the more he read, the deeper the pit in his stomach grew.\n\nEletam, the golden warrior, Elajith, the violet scholar… surely they could not have foreseen that this would have happened? It was as if all their wishes had been granted, but in the worst possible way. More tales of glory, of all kinds, were published in the Violet Library by the year, but their words were written in blood. The Goldswords brought order to Taychend, but they did so by sending off the warlords to ravage distant lands. Magnificent cities were built, but they were paid for with the looted treasures of a hundred civilisations.\n\nHe could see where this was leading. One day, the borders of the Dumrusvarn would encompass the world, with half of its realm a blasted waste. Taychend would be a glorious beacon of civilisation, built atop the corpses of hundreds of millions. And then the warlords, their desire for battle and conquest insatiable, would turn on him.\n\nDenariatam shook his head, stood, walked over to the nearby balcony so he could look once more over his city. He could do nothing to stop it – he knew that. But the cycle needed to turn from one of chaos, to one of order. If the warlords believed glory is violence, so be it – the Dumruktams had figured out it was so much more a long, long time ago. As the Emperor looked out over the city, he could see the bright lights of learning, and culture, and industry. One day, they would be the Goldsword’s saving grace against the blooded storm – Taychend will rise, an Empire Vainglorious…"
 taychendi_empire_events.29.asthanan: "…but by the will of Gold and Violet, it will not fall as one."
 taychendi_empire_events.29.dnakar: "The three cousins stared at the tomb in silence. They had spared no expense on the construction of their ancestor’s resting place, a mausoleum of richly painted marble and lapis-tiled stone. A great statue of Liandarha had been built behind the sarcophagus, cast in gold and Precursor steel, her famous bright orange hair replicated in fire.\n\nVatasheran Kriadvai-Mudaliar placed his hand on the stone. “Do you think she would be proud of us?”\nThe Queen of Kilaiek raised an eyebrow. “Why wouldn’t she be?” Galichana replied, incredulous. “She ruled Nanru Nakar – we rule half of Aelantir. If she saw us now, she’d smile upon us!”\n\n“Would she?” both cousins looked to the Emperor as he spoke. “Liandarha was an elf of Tacenie, but the warlords of our Empire look to the Slaver-Nobles she despised. Liandarha won this city off a slave revolt, while this Empire secured itself by destroying one. Do you think she’d like the bloodshed, the constant warfare?”\n\n“She was a warrior!” Kilaiek replied. “Of course she would!”\n“How could we know?” Kriadvai responded.\n“Does it matter?” Denariatam asked. The other two cousins looked askance at him. “It’s been over a millennium since she lived – and in that time, this city, this family… we’ve grown. Evolved. The way we rule those below, sitting up on the high chair, above the warlords – that was not Liandarha’s vision, that was Varanash’s! The way we rule ourselves, split into three and then rebound – that was not Liandarha’s vision, it was the vision of Triandar and Elechana and Pelozhil!”\n\nDenariatam looked up at the statue. “Liandarha was born amidst the skies, tethered to the light and order of Dhivumanhu… but she died in darkness, in a world of glorious chaos. That is the world in which we live and over which we reign… and it is through glory, and through chaos, that we shall end this cycle, and return the glory of Liandarha’s age to Aelantir. We will rise, an Empire Vainglorious…”"
 taychendi_empire_events.29.anakar: "“...and we rule amidst the skies again, an Empire Ascendant.”"

 taychendi_empire_events.200.d: "You have planned a big expedition into Nanru Nakar. The first hurdle is how much support you get from the Mudalairs, who control Nanru Nakar and the entrance to the undercity."

 taychendi_empire_events.201.d: "Your forces have go through the upper levels of the underground - the Nakari Undercity. A warren of maze-like slums and sewers and storerooms, the undercity is home to both environmental dangers and dangerous people. On top of that, the Scavenger Guilds of Nanru Nakar, who have great knowledge of the underground, have many connections there, as they often recruit undercity dwellers.

You pass through some of their settlements - it appears they have an entire culture of their own, with religious rituals dedicated primarily to fending off demons from above - but also monsters from below.

Soon, they ventured far enough that the signs of settlement were few, replaced by warning signs of every sort imaginable. Eventually, the army reached a great chamber, big enough to house and home a dragon - and that glowed bright blue with the radiance of damestear.\n\nThe expedition very quickly dicovered the source of the glow. The chamber was filled with hundreds of thousands of golden precursor slave collars, perhaps millions, the type used to control the indentured slaves of the Precursors from before the ruin.\n\nLying against the pile was a single skeleton, crowned and wearing a suit of resplendent precursor armour. There are few doubts as to its identity: the skeleton is that of Liandarha Mudaliar, and this chamber was her tomb."

There seemed to be a small damestear crystal in every single collar - a fortune's worth of damestear, to be sure. Not to mention the actual metal of the collars, which looked more like jewellery than shackles. But on closer examination many of the collars and crystals within were found to have been smashed and damaged deliberately.\n\nAnd having been degrading over the past millenium and a half, exposed to the air? That glow was poison. A slow one, but poison nonetheless. Nanru Nakar goes deeper than even this tomb, though if we want to secure the damestear we cannot go further.\n\nIn the event we decide to loot the tomb, Her descendants have made it clear they will be reclaiming Liandarha's remains. What we do with the collars and their damestear is for us to decide."

People disappearing, bodies being found drained of blood, shadows hunting in the night. Fearing a connection to the Cannorian woman from before, you summon her to you.\n\nShe reveals who she really is - Mihaela, the Errant Princess. A Vampire. She says that she was forced from her home, that her own sire-line tried to lock her away, just because she dared to use her own powers as they were meant to be used. Mihaela tells you that if you reject her, she will go away and never talk to you again, but if you accept the gift she offers, she can give you unimaginable power."
 taychendi_empire_events.301.a: "Yes"
 taychendi_empire_events.301.b: "No"

 taychendi_empire_events.302.t: "Meeting under the Moon"
 taychendi_empire_events.302.d: "Mihaela summons you for a meeting under the full moon. She congratulates you (and herself) on a job well done, with Taychend increasingly under the grip of vampiric warlords. Now she is ready to give the ultimate gift - though its slightly poisoned. She'll give you vampirism, make her your child... and then take over your Empire, rising as Veliara, the Pale Queen."

 taychendi_empire_events.303.t: "The Pale Queen Rises"
 taychendi_empire_events.303.d: "Mihaela is crowned as the “Pale Queen” of Taychend, in a ceremony at night, of course. The first event from her perspective - you now really get to see how self confident, absorbed and somewhat crazy she is. She makes a speech about how she's going to rule through strength and blood. Mihaela notices another Errant Prince, Theodore sína Trinás, in the crowd, and silently welcomes the Blood Court's inevitable attempt to dethrone her."
 taychendi_empire_events.303.a: "Option1"

 taychendi_empire_events.304.t: "A Game of Shadows"
 taychendi_empire_events.304.d: "Short event. Theodore sína Trinás is talking with Renaud about the failure of their efforts to combat Veliara in Taychend, and why they so need to urgently dislodge her from her rule. Theodore is clearly despondent about the whole affair, though he is clearly still willing to continue the fight. Finally, the pair decide to orchestrate another revolt within Taychend."

 taychendi_empire_events.305.d: "Mihaela finishes up killing a vampire hunter while your old ruler (is it possible to save their name and gender? If not then just a taychendi underling) watches on. They have a conversation about why Mihaela is in Taychend and the Taychendi guy (it would really fit better if it was your old ruler) monologues about how she fits in to Taychend. TLDR: you're the supreme warlords now - if might is the only thing that matters, then now we're the only thing that matters. Mihaela goes “yeah checks out”, and tells your old ruler that she is sure that the next time something like this happens, it'll be the last time - if this revolt fails, the Blood Court will send an Errant Prince."

 taychendi_empire_events.306.t: "A Duel at Midnight"
 taychendi_empire_events.306.d: "Starts with a conversation in Mihaela's trophy room between her and Theodore, who has been sent by the Blood Court to deal with her. She does the whole “Oh you're approaching me” and he does the “I can't torpor you without getting any closer” and then they fight. Short description of how it goes - basically Mihaela is more aggressive, knows the local terrain, including where running water and bridges are and which residences she has permission to enter, and she's willing to kill Theodore - even if it means killing a good chunk of the entire vampiric population. Eventually, she gets the upper hand and subdues him.\n\nMihaela laughed. “My my–you’re actually approaching me?”\n\nThe Errant Prince pulled an silver-thorned stake from his cloak, then drew his rapier. “I can’t torpor you without getting any closer!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.307.t: "Its in the Blood"
 taychendi_empire_events.307.d: "Victorious, Mihaela and the now captured Theodore, have a conversation about the Blood Court and vampiric society. After Theodore signs a peace deal on behalf of the blood court, Mihaela does a long rambling speech about the failings of Taychendi society and how she's just absolutely thriving off it, while Theodore goes full doomer mode about the future of Vampirekind - and the world as a whole."
