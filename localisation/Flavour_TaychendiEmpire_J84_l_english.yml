 J84_1_2_setting_the_sun_title: "Setting the Sun"
 J84_1_2_setting_the_sun_desc: "The “Jaherian Exemplars” – the prodigal sons and daughters of Tacenie’s empire. They came to Taychend to disperse the darkness, but in their arrogance they made two mistakes. First, they awoke a force even they could not control, their words the spark to the greatest peasant and slave movement since Vehasha’s own. Secondly, they underestimated us. Underestimated our people, underestimated our power, underestimated our history. They seek to destroy everything that made us great – but we will not let them."

 J84_1_4_hero_cults_of_the_exemplary_title: "Hero-Cults of the Exemplary"
 J84_1_4_hero_cults_of_the_exemplary_desc: "The Exemplars are powerful beyond measure, a military and religious organisation without equal – but they turned their power to foolish pursuits, chasing shadows across Aelantir and beyond. Their organisation is so similar to the organisation of our own Hero-Cults and religious brotherhoods – if we turned their cult of exemplary into a cult of glory, we could use their power in the expansion of our Empire, while the Warlord-Heralds do what they wish with the Dry Coast. \n\nThere are, of course, those who view this as a fool’s errand too – should this effort prove too difficult, we can simply expel these prodigal elves, and fold the Taychendi immigrants who had moved to their lands into our empire."

 J84_1_5_ending_an_exile_title: "Ending an Exile"
 J84_1_5_ending_an_exile_desc: "The Dugui’hi, the original denizens of the Mushroom Forest to the north. Their mercenaries and travelling alchemists have been a notable if uncommon sight through Taychend since their exile in the 1200s – but all know their eyes have always been on their original home. The Advakhalla of Sedregenghi were close to supporting an effort to end their exile in the mid 1400s, but the venture failed – by finishing the job, we may be able to add to our empire a valuable new province indeed, as the riches of the Mushroom Forest will flow to us from a grateful people."

 J84_2_2_institutional_apotheosis_title: "Institutional Apotheosis"
 J84_2_2_institutional_apotheosis_desc: "The veneration of a ruler’s ancestors is a powerful tool in any warlord’s playbook. It allows one to cast themselves as having the personal favour of those gods, by virtue of blood, and provides a direct channel with which any subject can direct sacrifices and offerings to the ruling dynasty. The Imperial Cult, therefore, is a vital part of any Taychendi empire – and it will be for our own as well. By building temples to the imperial family’s deceased members and previous rulers, and investing into a powerful organisation that will oversee the various hero-cults to those ascended gods, we can entrench the image of the imperial family, and remind all of the glory of our empire."

 J84_2_3_the_weaver_of_fates_title: "The Weaver of Fates"
 J84_2_3_the_weaver_of_fates_desc: "The Fateweaver of Korrimutren is one of the most powerful oracles anywhere in the world, a great divination relic hooked directly into the skeletal corpse of a Precursor mage, that can allow a powerful enough divination mage to see directly – and almost always truly – into the future. The Fateweaver’s predictions have driven Taychendi history – they sparked the Chendhyan invasions, brought low the First Gophiran empire and in the process ensured the Second Empire’s rise, and, of course, it granted Laskaris the Conqueror a fate-woven shield of quasi-immortality that would spur his conquests in Taychend. We cannot leave fate to chance – it is time [Ruler.Monarch.GetName] paid the Weaver of Fates a visit."

 J84_2_4_agricultural_evolution_title: "Agricultural Evolution"
 J84_2_4_agricultural_evolution_desc: "The land of Taychend, and the three great rivers that dominate it – the Vyech, the Endioka, the Kalavend – is one of the most bountiful in Taychend. When the glaciers melt, and the storm clouds gather, the farms of Taychend produce enough grain to feed tens of millions. At the height of the Second Gophiran Empire, it is said that Taychend’s goliath agricultural base supported a population of 40 million – but the death throes of Gophira ravaged that base. By 1400, the Taychendi population had dropped by half. If we are to become the greatest empire Taychend has ever seen, we will need to invest in plant growth magic, grain silos, irrigation – and not just expand, but evolve that which feeds our cities and our armies."

 J84_2_5_paths_of_ascention_title: "Paths of Ascention"
 J84_2_5_paths_of_ascention_desc: "The Violet Library, the venerable institution that formed the heart of the enlightened and prosperous Dannuka Dumrusvarn of Taychendi late antiquity, is known for expending tremendous effort into documenting the deeds of any god heroes they can find, storing tens of thousands of records within their labyrinthine archives.\n\nIn their efforts, they have developed a concept called “the Thousand Paths of Ascension”, which seeks to highlight paths aside from warfare that can lead to apotheosis. If we are to build a glorious empire, we need our smiths, our architects, our dockhands, our shopkeeps and bakers – we cannot have everyone throwing themselves into the fray of battle. Perhaps, then, it may be worth officially supporting this idea?"

 J84_3_1_a_warlord_empire_title: "A Warlord Empire"
 J84_3_1_a_warlord_empire_desc: "Ebenanth, Yodhan, Varanash, Ultarlan, Olhokar – we stand in the same place those great conquerors once stood: unifier of Taychend. But we are only here because the empires of those elves crumbled after their deaths, as they either exploded into rebellion or stagnated and weakened over decades – we must not repeat the same mistake.\n\nWe are an empire of warlords – our power is built on them, and our future greatness will be won by them. But unlike our predecessors, as our conquests bring those warlords loot and plunder, we will not waste those riches – our ambition and our glory will be the crucible that will raise cities, monuments, bend the way of the world itself! Taychend will rise once more, as the empire to end all empires, and Taychend will rise alone, by it’s own strength – as the Empire Vainglorious!"

 J84_3_3_vaona_gophira_title: "Vaona Gophira"
 J84_3_3_vaona_gophira_desc: "The Gophirans moved millions of elven slaves across their empire at their height, using them to construct great monuments and extract the resources of their empire. Though we must do the same, there is a great problem – we can no longer rely on the wars of glory, the unrestricted wars between warlords, that truly supported Taychend’s slave population. To kickstart our slave economy, we must look abroad for new targets, and stimulate the various slave markets through our empire. Only then can the Periyodhai, the constant semi-ritualised battles between warlords and city-states, sustain the cycle of terror and brutality that underpins the engines of vainglory."

 J84_3_4_a_land_of_cities_title: "A Land of Cities"
 J84_3_4_a_land_of_cities_desc: "In Taychend, the city-state is the base unit of politics and society. They range in size from walled farming-villages to great metropolises, their warlords ranging from respected community members appointed by their community to absolutist warlord-kings, who can command tens of thousands of warriors. Care must be paid to those small city-states, of course – but that is the job of the greater ones. By investing in those greater city states, we can create scores of star-like cities, that radiate their prosperity out to the territories under their control."

 J84_3_6_beyond_taychend_title: "Beyond Taychend"
 J84_3_6_beyond_taychend_desc: "Andeios is ours. The heart of southern Aelantir, a land of magnificent cities, great peoples, legendary stories and myths, is now under our total control. But as we have so dearly learned, there is a world beyond Taychend – the Empire Vainglorious may rise alone, but it will not rise in isolation.\n\nNew ways of dealing with magic are being pioneered, new religions, professing ancient truths and possessing cutting-edge innovations, are sprouting up across the world. And the warlords, gorged on the vainglory of their conquests, are clamouring for new foes to invade, new riches to plunder – and as news of new discoveries arrive in our ports, they clamour for new secrets to unlock and powers to gain. We won’t deny their demands. \n\nOne wonders if we could…"

 J84_4_2_suffer_no_interloper_title: "Suffer No Interloper"
 J84_4_2_suffer_no_interloper_desc: "“Taychend suffers no interloper.” The origin of the saying is unknown, with three dozen cities claiming their local god-hero was the first to say it. That only points to the prevalence of the sentiment – the destiny of Taychend is for the Taychendi alone to control. Laskaris the Conqueror intervened in our affairs when he launched his invasion – and then the city-state he ruled attempted to destroy our way of life. That cannot be allowed to stand – Ameion, as well as the two smaller cities that provided aid to their cause, must be seized, and the Kheionai must be taught a lesson they will not forget."

 J84_4_4_the_rhythm_of_war_title: "The Rhythm of War"
 J84_4_4_the_rhythm_of_war_desc: "There is little more glorious than war. The rush of battle, the elation of seeing the enemy rout before you, as the red-rays of the blooded sun of victory settle, and the vultures circle over a field of the dead. The dance of battle, and the rhythm of war. The Taychendi know it like no other – and they know that few others excel at it like they do.\n\nThey are so good at it, in fact, that enough competing military doctrines and ways of war have sprouted up over the years that one Taychendi army is often very different to another – if we are to claim our glory, however, we must march to the drum-beat we know best…"

 J84_4_5_titans_of_the_sea_title: "Titans of the Sea"
 J84_4_5_titans_of_the_sea_desc: "The seas may be terrifying to most Taychendi, but with experienced Kheionai sailors now being drawn from our Cleaved Sea territories, and the powerful Degárikes, as well as new designs of sail and mast, designed for the open ocean, Taychend has the opportunity to become a maritime power as well as a great land power – if the empire is to truly become the master of Andeios, it must learn to become the master of the waves."

 J84_5_2_we_will_make_you_care_title: "We Will Make You Care"
 J84_5_2_we_will_make_you_care_desc: "In good times, the Chendhyan steppe is far from the minds of most Taychendi rulers – those that have the luxury of ever being able to put the riders of the steppe out of their mind, that is. But as we grow in power, whispers stir of a gathering storm on the steppe, as the minor tribes of the Chendhya seek to challenge our power, and preserve their freedom. There are various groups who would like to see that challenge be furiously answered – perhaps it is time their calls were answered?"

 J84_5_3_raiders_of_the_moon_title: "Raiders of the Moon"
 J84_5_3_raiders_of_the_moon_desc: "There are few who are as good at raiding as the descendants of Munakles, or Munazhlan as they call him. Mounted on their feline cavalry, or else armed with the powers to move rock and soil itself, they have fiercely defended their freedom over the years by military means – but as our soldiers finally sweep over their lands, it seems their efforts are gradually coming to naught. That does not mean they cannot be useful, however – the Chendhyans of the Guaraddhi already adopted our ways once. Perhaps their cousins on the far steppe, and in the Mteibas valley, can be convinced to do a similar thing."

 J84_5_4_monuments_of_the_water_title: "Monuments of the Water"
 J84_5_4_monuments_of_the_water_desc: "Though the Taychendi have never truly been at home on the sea, the storms of the southern seas warding off most from straying away from sight of land, greed and glory both have turned the Taychendi to the waves time and time again, as trade with the Kheionai brings wealth back to Taychend – and the power of their great ships occasionally make themselves known.\n\nAfter Laskaris invaded Taychend, there were once more efforts to unlock the secrets of Kheionai naval power – and in the Degárikes, monuments of the water, so great and powerful it is a glorious endeavour to build one in itself, the key was found. Devand will soon fall – but if we are to invade Alecand, we must build a fleet of these ships, and finally beat the Kheionai at their own game."

 J84_5_5_the_hand_that_mocks_title: "The Hand That Mocks"
 J84_5_5_the_hand_that_mocks_desc: "The Kheionai presumed to be superior to us. They eschewed worship of the gods in favour of mortal words and sayings, drinking their wine and carving their pretty statues. Our elites indulged in some of their ways, sure, importing Paraidar wine and Potidhano glass – but they never fell to their mindset. As they sat secure in their prison-cities, engaging in petty skirmishes and trade wars, we fought cataclysmic wars, storms of blood and fire. Laskaris thought he would bring their ways to us – instead, we will bring the storm to them, and show them what is truly the “superior” people."

 J84_5_6_the_heart_that_feeds_title: "The Heart That Feeds"
 J84_5_6_the_heart_that_feeds_desc: "We showed the Kheionai the reality of our own power, our own glory – but we cannot underestimate their own qualities. They may not be superior, but it is difficult indeed to say they are not our near-equal, and that naturally means we must begin to treat them not as hostile enemies, but valuable subjects.\n\nThere is another option, though. A voice that says that today they are our near equal, and tomorrow they may prove they are more than that. A voice that says not to take the risk. Says to break them, once and for all… and to seize the hidden riches beneath their precious cities for our own gain. But we wouldn’t be so desperate to consume what we have so recently gained, ruin future territories, just to secure our power today, and gain temporary riches… would we?"

 #Events
 taychendi_empire_events.1.t: "Fate of the Chendhya"
 taychendi_empire_events.1.da: "The Grandmaster, kneeling, bowed his head low as he finished his appeal. The Bloodcloaks arrayed behind him in the throne room, faces hidden behind their plate-and-mail helmets, shrouded in capes of dark red cloth, bowed in unison as well. On the millennial anniversary of the Ruin, Olhokar the Fortuitous had received a similar appeal – to grant the Brotherhood of the Bloody Cloak stewardship of the Chendhya.\n\nToday, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was flanked by two trusted warlords – Teshekar Takasangamar stood to one side, Andyzha Vakyrlana, of Darkalyndar, to the other. Teshekar leaned in first. “These elves are noble, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They guarded the frontier for centuries – even during Gophira’s fall, they upheld their sacred vows, never took sides! My family have sent many of our members to join their ranks – I know they’ll make good stewards, loyal and true.”\n\nAndzyha scoffed at that. “These Bloodcloaks are villains, renegades! Simply the worst people imaginable! They use their “vows” as excuses to terrorise innocent Chendhyans for fun – if “protecting the steppe” means riding around cutting tents, slaughtering livestock and whisking away women and children as slaves, then they “protect” very well indeed!”\n\n“Slander!” the Grandmaster called, as he rose to challenge Andyzha’s words. “We work only to protect Taychend from the Chendhyan hordes! For fun? You think we exact pleasure from our work?” When the warlord of Darkalyndar ostentatiously mouthed a “yes”, the Grandmaster drew the Greatsabre hanging on his back. “The steel of vengeance knows no pleasure, you barbarous, cat-riding whore–! I’ll have your–!”\n\n“Enough!” [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood suddenly, and the hall calmed at an instant. The Grandmaster shrunk back at the admonishment. “The Brotherhood’s appeal…”"
 taychendi_empire_events.1.db: "From Ebenanth Starshear’s Western Expedition, to the intervention of the Three Tribes in the Lanahine War, the pacification campaigns of the Mudaliar Empire, or Darakash Threadsworn’s stunning expedition through the steppe, Taychendi-Chendhyan history was as bloody as it was storied – and stagnant. Then, Ultarlan the Decimator arose.\n\nUltarlan united the Chendhyan tribes, and over the course of a decade conquered all Taychend. Though he was assassinated soon after, and his son Geladhlan – variously known as both “the Stoneburner” and “the Emancipator” – would fall victim to inter-tribal feuds, his empire collapsing with his death, the leftover Chendhyan kingdoms – Ezhudars – remained in power for decades. It would be these remnant kingdoms that would truly see Chendhyans adapt to Taychendi ways.\n\nBy the time Olhokar the Fortuitous rose and swept the remnant kingdoms away, a significant proportion of the Chendhyans in Taychend had adopted Taychendi religion, fighting wars for glory rather than simply defence. Most importantly, they had also adopted slavery – though they would never stoop so low as to enslave other Chendhyans, these “Chainforger” Chendhyans became active participants in the Andeiosian slave trade, selling Taychendi or Kheionai captives taken in raids to whoever would buy them.\n\nBe it the Ezhudar of Zaernmaera, who ravaged the Taychendi frontier in the early 1400s, Darkalyndar, who have served the Gophirans faithfully for centuries, or the Haebyziae tribe, who formed the backbone of Oremvand’s military, these Chainforger Chendhyans have proven themselves powerful and amenable to our ways time and time again. Perhaps we can cultivate this strength, and either give them more autonomy or sponsor the further adoption of Taychendi practices among their people?"

 taychendi_empire_events.2.d: "Alazhlan held tightly to the scruff of his feline mount’s dotted coat, as it deftly climbed the outcropping. When they had reached the pinnacle, he surveyed the army before him. Tens of thousands of Chendhyans had gathered on the plains, all for one purpose, all under his direction, and all for one reason. Alazhlan, Asadezheg of Saerraeg – the King of all Chendhyans – raised his sword towards the sky.\n\n“Chendhyans!” he called, and a roar unending answered, every mount and rider below crying out for freedom. “The slavers have united! A new empire of warlords has arisen – and they WILL seek to invade us! Destroy our way of life! Take our lives, our land, our freedom!” They always did – it was their nature, and had been from the days of the ancient Slaver-Nobles, and would be until the day they purged the vainglory from their hearts. That would not be this day, though – so instead, they would fight. “A hundred thousand elves and more march for the steppe – but will we stand by and watch as they subjugate us?”\n\nForty thousand elves answered in unison, their voices shaking the very earth – “Never!”\n\n“They are many, and we are few!” Alazhlan called. “But will we let that cower us?” “Never!” “Death awaits us! But will we let that break us!” “Never!” The Chendhyans raised their swords and spears towards the sky in defiance. “They want to buy our bodies with gold – but what will be our price?” “Blood! Blood! Blood!”\n\nAlazhlan beamed, even as the pit in his stomach deepened. He pointed his sword to the east – to Taychend, to death, to the end of everything they treasured. “Then ride with me, Chendhyans! Ride to war! Ride to vengeance! Ride to freedom!”"
 taychendi_empire_events.2.a: "The Chendhya roars, doomed and defiant."

 taychendi_empire_events.3.t: "Crazy, Crazy, Crazy"
 taychendi_empire_events.3.d: "As Seluslavi translated her owner’s words from Yodhanpir to Kalavendhi, Galinpan Kattyva threw his arms up in exasperation. “I’m not letting you have their city! I’m giving you half the population as slaves, their wealth, their livestock, even the warlord’s wife and children! What more could you want?” Seluslavi stole a glance at the aforementioned warlord on the other end of the table, staring straight ahead, despondent, while his overlord – the one supposed to be mediating – sold him out.\n\nThis was a Periyodhai – a semi-ritualised battle, with predetermined stakes, fought between two relatively equal vassals of a greater warlord. Everyone knew “Hurahara the Humungous” would win, though, so they were really negotiating his “prize”. She’d been the receiving end of one of these negotiations – the village star, a scholar destined for the Dumran Vustarvach. Now she was a slave, and she translated, and read her illiterate master stories, and provided him “comfort” when he demanded. And she longed for death, and never had the guts to seek it, and so Seluslavi translated.\n\nHurahara fumed, tried to control his rage for a second, then burst. “I WANT HIS CITY!” he boomed, as he slammed a fist down on the table so hard it nearly upended it. “I WANT HIS PEOPLE! I WANT THEM ALL!” The Kattyva didn’t need a translation to sigh in exasperation. It was easy to see what the Royakottari warlord desired. He had overextended himself in Yodhanchend looking for relics, and he wanted multiple reliable warlords to hold his lands there, not one ignorant brute called Hurahara the Humungous, whose neglect would ruin scavenging operations there for a generation.\n\nBut Hurahara was crazy, crazy, crazy, and he just didn’t care. The Kattyva finally gave in – and soon Seluslavi was translating that too. Hurahara seemed satisfied – Galinpan Kattyva silently counted up the costs of a military expedition. If the Kattyva won, she’d be sold off, taken by some saner lieutenant, maybe. Or she’d be killed when they took Hurahara’s home city. She’d like that. Tomorrow, she knew, the people in that warlord’s town would be wishing the exact same thing."
 taychendi_empire_events.3.a: "Hurahara beat the warlord, then he beat the Kattyva. Seluslavi lived another twenty years."

 taychendi_empire_events.4.t: "Beneath the Hills of Korrimutren"
 taychendi_empire_events.4.da: "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] stepped into the Fateweaver’s chamber, he couldn’t help but be swallowed up by its majesty. The massive hall, carved deep into the hills, was bathed in the blue glow that emanated from the great damestear-jewel at its far end. Beneath it, at the apex of a pyramid of smooth-stone steps, hung the skeletal corpse of the Fateweaver – its arms outstretched and skull wrenched back, pierced with the relic-threads of prophecy, tendrils of ruin-steel that rose to the crystal above.\n\n“Beautiful, is it not?” the Threadbearer asked, as she walked up besides the Emperor. “We ought to go closer.” It took them a few minutes to reach the base of the stairs. Each step, Denariatam knew, was one taken by Darakash, Olhokar, Laskaris, countless conquerors and warlords and traders and politicians of ages past. They had each sought a glimpse of the future beneath the hills of Korrimutren – now, it was Denariatam’s turn.\n\nAs they reached the steps, the Threadbearer turned, motioned the Emperor to halt. “When I commune with the Fateweaver, I channel a power above any you could imagine. My own exceptional divination abilities are all that prevent a very gruesome death… do you know how to feel the future as I do?” Denariatam nodded, with the confidence only a powerful mage could muster. “Then step forth, and claim your destiny. I will wait here.”\n\nDenariatam ascended to the Fateweaver’s corpse. Her skeletal face was wrenched upwards – even worn to bone, he could see the agony of her final moments. The Emperor took a deep breath, closed his eyes, then placed his hand on the Precursor’s skull – immediately, unimaginable power surged through him. For a moment, he thought he had misjudged his strength, as the raw magics of an ancient being coursed through him, tore through his mind – then, his eyes snapped open, and he bore witness to a world beyond his own…"
 taychendi_empire_events.4.db: "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] stepped into the Fateweaver’s chamber, he couldn’t help but be swallowed up by its majesty. The massive hall, carved deep into the hills, was bathed in the blue glow that emanated from the great damestear-jewel at its far end. Beneath it, at the apex of a pyramid of smooth-stone steps, hung the skeletal corpse of the Fateweaver – its arms outstretched and skull wrenched back, pierced with the relic-threads of prophecy, tendrils of ruin-steel that rose to the crystal above.\n\n“Beautiful, is it not?” the Threadbearer asked, as she walked up besides the Emperor. “We ought to go closer.” It took them a few minutes to reach the base of the stairs. Each step, Denariatam knew, was one taken by Darakash, Olhokar, Laskaris, countless conquerors and warlords and traders and politicians of ages past. They had each sought a glimpse of the future beneath the hills of Korrimutren – now, it was Denariatam’s turn.\n\nAs they reached the steps, the Threadbearer turned, motioned the Emperor to halt. “When I commune with the Fateweaver, I will be channelling a power above any you could imagine. My own exceptional divination abilities are all that prevent a very gruesome death… are you as strong as me?” Denariatam shook his head, blushing slightly despite his station – the Threadbearer nodded. “Then I shall commune for you. Stand back.”\n\nThe Threadbearer ascended to the Fateweaver’s corpse. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes, then placed her hand on the Precursor’s skull. All was calm for a moment, as wisps of magic trailed up the Threadbearer’s hand – then her eyes snapped open, glowing brilliant and blue. The wisps became a rush, as the Threadbearer’s pure white gown billowed against its force, and a light within the jewel above burned bright enough to blind, and the world seemed to tremble at the power…"

 taychendi_empire_events.5.t: "The Glory of Steel"
 taychendi_empire_events.5.da: "Denariatam saw blurred images, snapping from one scene to the next. Armies marched through jungles, deserts, marshes, the Taychendi flag hoisted over cities of strange buildings – first some clearly Kheionai, then strange styles, with golden domes, smooth black spires, wooden cottages and honey-comb fortresses. Then back to Taychend – a scene on the Kalavend, blood soaked fields and broken bodies, with the Gathyanavaida tall in the background. A bolt from the astral whizzes through where it’s head would be, hurtling right towards the Emperor.\n\nDenariatam’s vision turned as if to run away – but a white-fanged shadow surprised him and pounced, its maw plunging him into darkness. The world was still for a moment – then there was a blinding burning light, a blazing sun rising and a sun-spot soldier within, wings sprouting from his back. He drew twin blades, and lunged.\n\nThe Emperor snapped awake from the communion with a start, staggering back. “Be careful…” the Threadbearer said, as her hand steadied him, “the first time is always difficult. What did you see?”\n\nDenariatam stared ahead at the Fateweaver’s corpse, frowning. “Strange new lands… and dangers in the dark. Blood and battle…” the corners of his lips crept upwards “...and glory. Strange new lands, and exotic new territories. Dangers from the dark, and dangers to be overcome.” Denariatam smiled."
 taychendi_empire_events.5.db: "The communion was over in less than a minute. In a heartbeat, everything suddenly stopped – the Threadbearer released her hand from the Fateweaver’s corpse, and the raw, rushing power of magic ceased, motes and wisps all that remained. After taking a moment to collect herself, she turned and descended the steppes silently, her face an unreadable mask.\n\n“So?” Denariatam asked tentatively. “What did you learn?” Was his empire to fall? Would he need to sacrifice his firstborn son? Would he be unkillable until he turned 61 years old? Or would he see unparalleled success? Glory and riches unrivalled?\n\nThe Threadbearer paused for a moment, her eyes moving to the sword at Denariatam’s hip. “Your armies will be uncountable, their advance unstoppable. Your empire will march to the ends of this world, conquer lands not yet seen by Elvenkind… but you will also fight enemies closer to home.” She looked up into the Emperor’s eyes. “Enemies await abroad – and daggers, of fanged teeth and shadow-shrouded steel, await you at home… waiting to strike, and waiting to take what they think is theirs.” The Threadbearer gave a little bow, her prophecy relayed, then began to walk back to the chamber.\n\n“Conquest, and steel, and daggers in the dark…” the Emperor said to himself, as he looked back to the great statue behind him. After pondering for a moment, he smiled. “Yes… I think I can work with that.”"
 taychendi_empire_events.5.a: "“Steel and struggle and victory – I think I can work with that!”"
 taychendi_empire_events.5.b: "Steel and glory and danger await – but so does victory."

 taychendi_empire_events.6.t: "Death and Terror and Ruin"
 taychendi_empire_events.6.da: "Denariatam was “standing” in a city – the people strange, the buildings stranger. He saw black ships sail high above – and then to the east, the gilded storm on the ground. He recognised them as his own people – as Taychendi. The strangers around him turned to watch – then turned to flee. But the wave overcame them. The scene changed – the world burned, the world bled. Now, Denariatam saw the apocalypse, blurred but so vivid, so real.\n\nCorpses were piled high, the blood pooled up to their ankles, millions, desecrated and defiled. Wood and stone burned and broke apart. Then he saw another city destroyed, then another, then five and ten and twenty more. Then a parade of shackled slaves, a hundred abreast, that stretched for miles and miles – they were each brutalised, bloody, missing limbs, blinded and wailing and retching and groaning. Denariatam realised he was not alone, for besides the slaves a gilded Emperor stood watching – one with his own face. When a brilliant blue light arose and bathed the bloodied world in its warmth, slave and emperor both turned to watch.\n\nTacenie rose above the horizon. Bright, glorious. The last relic of the past. Then it fell.\n\nEven a disembodied voice, Denariatam felt the heat and the power and the pain. The sounds of tens of millions screaming at once in terror. His double merely watched on, even as the Ruin-come-again flayed the skin off his face. He looked so, so proud\n\nThe Emperor snapped awake from the communion with a start, staggering back. “My Emperor!” the Threadbearer pleaded, steadying his fall. “You looked in such pain– I thought you weren’t going to make it! You must tell me, what did you see?” Only now did Denariatam notice the fast-paced beating of his heart, the sweat that drenched his body, the lingering burning sensation on his skin. The Emperor wrenched himself from the Threadbearer’s hand, and turned to leave."
 taychendi_empire_events.6.db: "The communion was over in less than a minute. The rush of magic ceased in a heartbeat, as the Threadbearer released her hand from the Fateweaver’s corpse. The Threadbearer did not move – it took a moment for Denariatam to realise something was wrong, and hurry up the steps towards her. Sweat dripped down the Threadbearer’s brow, as she stared still ahead at the skull before her – her eyes wide with terror. When Denariatam tried to rouse her, she turned startled, recoiled from his touch and stumbled back, falling to the floor. “What happened?” Denariatam asked. “What did you see!?”\n\nHer voice was tinged with horror. “Death! Death and terror and ruin! So much destruction, so much– by the gods, the blood! The screams–!”\nA chill went up Denariatam’s spine. “What did you see, oracle!? Whose blood, whose screams?!”\n“The world’s!” The Threadbearer cried. “My Emperor, the world’s! I saw men, women, children, thrown onto the pyres of their burning cities… hacked apart by sabre and shot, flayed alive by mage-fire! Black ships sailed, bays of chains and chattle, wailing, groaning– Taychendi, Kheionai, scaled monsters and green-hided brutes, whatever, whoever, it didn’t matter! The world weeping blood– by the gods, the crimes… the terrible crimes!” The Threadbearer threw her hands over her face to hide her tears.\n\n“Gods…” Denariatam muttered, “why must you toy with us so?” He stepped back, turned to the jewel above. Rage and terror mixed in his heart. “Damnable fate! You give us portents but no prophecy! WHAT MUST WE DO!?”\n“Tacenie…” the Threadbearer whispered. Denariatam’s head snapped back – the Threadbearer’s arms fell limply by her side. She looked off into the distance. “I saw Tacenie, rising above.” Then turned towards her Emperor. “And then it fell, and the flame of Ruin shattered the world. And you were watching, staring…"
 taychendi_empire_events.6.a: "“I saw nothing. I saw nothing at all...”"
 taychendi_empire_events.6.b: "“...and you looked proud, Denariatam. So proud…”"

 taychendi_empire_events.7.t: "Mechanical Hearts and Grinding Gears"
 taychendi_empire_events.7.da: "Denariatam saw blurred images, visions, snapping from one scene to the next. Mages and tinkerers, most Taychendi but some strange, short or scaled, worked in laboratories, unearthed underground chambers, artefacts. He saw a kotakompu being pulled apart and reassembled in steel – the tortured beast noticed him and pounced. Then all dark – and the pulse of beating blood and whirring, crackling mana surged around him. Then the darkness cracked, and with the tearing of flesh and the whirring of steel, the walls of red-iron tore away – and a monster, a beast bigger than any the Emperor had ever seen before, revealed itself. It rose through the storm, reality warping around it’s immensity, incomprehension digging into Denariatam’s soul.\n\nThe Emperor snapped awake from the communion with a start, staggering back. “Be careful…” the Threadbearer said, as her hand steadied him, “the first time is always difficult. What did you see?”\n\nDenariatam wanted to say that he didn’t know. That he hadn’t the faintest idea. That the world was upside down and left was right. Then he took a deep breath, got a grip, and simply said whatever came to mind. “I suppose… I saw mechanical hearts and grinding gears, chambers reliquary and valves mechanical. I saw Taychend pulse with the damestear-blood of magic, the world torn apart by the ambition of… of…”\n\nDenariatam felt a presence behind him – though even as he turned, he knew there was nothing there. The ambition of ourselves, or of those of the past? The lines seemed to shift and blur before him, past and present and future ill-defined."
 taychendi_empire_events.7.db: "The communion was over in less than a minute. In a heartbeat, everything suddenly stopped – the Threadbearer released her hand from the Fateweaver’s corpse, and the raw, rushing power of magic ceased, motes and wisps all that remained. After taking a moment to collect herself, she turned and descended the steppes silently. She looked troubled, anxious even.\n\n“So?” Denariatam asked tentatively. “What did you learn?” Was his empire to fall? Would he need to sacrifice his firstborn son? Would he be unkillable until he turned 61 years old? Or would he see unparalleled success? Glory and riches unrivalled?\n\nThe Threadbearer paused for a moment, as if troubled, then finally gave the Emperor his future. “Your mages, your scholars, your scientists… the brains of Taychend will be pushed to their limit – and in doing so, the very seams of nature shall be torn apart, the divide between hot blood and cold steel muddying under our power. And with mechanical hearts within, and the sound of grinding gears behind…?” The Threadbearer looked away from Denariatam – past him, as if whatever she had seen in the prophecy was behind the Emperor. “You will confront forces that will stretch comprehension itself.”\n\nThe Threadbearer shook her head as if to clear it, then turned back to Denariatam. “I am sorry, the communion was tiring… please, leave whenever you see fit.” Then she hurried off, and the Emperor was left alone – the past glowing bright before him, and the future towering high behind him."
 taychendi_empire_events.7.a: "The Emperor wondered if that was so bad after all."
 taychendi_empire_events.7.b: "When we reach the pinnacle, will we be enticed to fall?"

 taychendi_empire_events.8.t: "On Apotheosis"
 taychendi_empire_events.8.d: "Camnan looked on sullenly as the victorious soldiers marched home. He could see friends and family all passing by, brandishing wounds and bloodied weapons with the same vigour and cheer. Their town had won a series of Periyodhai recently, their warriors besting all the neighbouring city-states – Gadivelgar and Ulmukilavand and Denvephirsi. And while they won glory, he’d been stuck at home, jewelling. Camnan looked down to his withered legs – and the wheeled chair that held them.\n\nThe jeweller heard a loud tut from behind him. “Each parade, I find you in such a state. Must you wallow in regret like so?” Camnan turned – Jalinwathi, the local priest of Elajith, and a member of the Violet Brotherhood, stood, arms crossed and a faint smile across his face.\n\nCamnan shrugged, frowning. “My friends win glory on the battlefield day by day – why, Varanran has slain so many foes he may well ascend! Meanwhile I’m stuck here… tinkering!” The jeweller looked to the parade again. “How am I supposed to attain glory if I can’t fight?”\n\n“The same way your sister’s writing grants glory, or old Trianran’s smithing – why, that elf made half the weapons used in that battle! You make wonders every month, and you still feel inadequate? Foolishness, Camnan, foolishness– there are many paths to ascension! And in Dhivumanhu, smith and soldier both drink from the same Pheni barrel!”\n\nCamnan scoffed. “Then why do we love war and battle so? The Empire marches east and west, north and south– how could you get more glorious than that?”\n\nNow it was Jalinwathi’s turn to frown. “Elvenkind has always craved the easy path. And blood and violence is easy… but sometimes it is being turned from the easy that allows one to seek the fulfilling.” The priest looked to the parade. “Perhaps Taychend will turn from the easy path one day…”"
 taychendi_empire_events.8.a: "“...but until then, your works will shine brighter than steel.”"

 taychendi_empire_events.9.t: "The Hand that Mocks"
 taychendi_empire_events.9.d: "Denariatam watched the Royakottari labourers from afar, as they finally broke into the core of Degakheion’s Windward – it’s Kheinilián. The blue glow of magic erupted from the steel casing. The harsh glow turned his eyes to the sky above – and send a wave of unease rippling through him. Denariatam turned to the woman standing to his side, furiously scribbling in her notebook.\n\n“Are you certain we are safe, here?” Denariatam asked. “With the Windward gone– what if a storm strikes?”\n“We are safe,” Lelijitha Vustarin bluntly stated, not caring to look up from her notes. “We’ve done evacuation drills fifteen times… no, sixteen. Any residents will die, but our labourers will be safely in Ormam before any disaster strikes.”\nThe Emperor shook his head, as he turned back to the excavation. “Riches for us, fear for them, but it is ill-delivered – Degakheion was a proud city of glorious warriors. I should have chosen Oktikheion.”\n“And why did I counsel you otherwise?”\nDenariatam frowned. “Yes, yes, I know… my compunctions are exactly why it needed to be targeted. I see that, but even so…”\n\nThe Vustarin Matriarch finally looked up from her notebook. “The old Kheionai used to be mere prisoners of Tacenie, by my estimation. The Phylaxana were the last of their wardens. They clung to a long obsolete duty, a relic of the last cycle, just like – and forgive the slander – the Mudaliars. Unlike the Mudaliars, though, they used their ancestry to justify mocking the ways of all those opposed to them, even other Kheionai, like the Karkares they kept under “watch”. They never would have accepted our ways, and so they needed to serve as an example. Degakheion will remain forever a tombstone for Kheionai exceptionalism. A sign that our might, our fury, is more than equal to their “sophistication.”"
 taychendi_empire_events.9.a: "The Emperor crossed his arms. “Our fury, yes… and our pride."

 taychendi_empire_events.10.t: "Zopedan Completely Disassembled"
 taychendi_empire_events.10.d: "For the past 20 years, labourers from Royakottar - who have experience excavating precursor steel - have been chipping away at the Zopedan (“Windward”) in the now-abandoned Degakheion. It has been tough work finding all of the damestear-alloy conduits that pulse through the city, as well as to dig out the entirety of the massive damestear core of the city, the Kheinilián.\n\nNow, however, as the final shipments of Precursor steel and damestear sail back to Taychend, they have finally finished their task, and the city can return to its previous trade – though Degakheion is now effectively a “dead” city – a tombstone for the age when the Kheions were once untouchable, and its “citizens”, such as they are, will have to evacuate each time a Kaydhano Deathwind approaches."
 taychendi_empire_events.10.a: "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert…"

 taychendi_empire_events.11.t: "Don't Call Me A Hoplophile"
 taychendi_empire_events.11.da: "Statue head replaced already"
 taychendi_empire_events.11.db: "The Emperor of Taychend followed the artificers as they showed him their inventions outside Palaya Orenkoraim, the Gathyanavaida looming large in the background. A short fellow in a funny hat, “Sando Brassbottle”, led him around, as his assistants gave demonstrations of each invention. “Here– T-Wave transmitters, connects like lightning– oh, and speaking of lightning– sparkdrives! Any enemies? Bad doud? Pull the trigger and… toddo! Dead! And here... hmm, the “Maagikraftfayermaszeene”- thaumaturgical arcano-blaster cannon, yes? Supercharged a little, modified by me– it is… ah, not yet perfect, yes? Will backfire, mmm… 49.5% of the time? Needs a bit more “geelder” to fix, if you understand.”\n\nThe Emperor understood perfectly. The other weapons and inventions interested him, and greatly – but they were single-target weapons. He wanted devastation, and this arcane blaster thing looked like it could give him it. Denariatam pointed to the statue in the distance – and the palace where its head once stood. “Ebenanth, the First Emperor, decapitated that statue with a bolt from the Astral Sky. Precise annihilation – give me that, and I’ll give you more gold than you can imagine.”\n\nSando understood the assignment. He scratched his beard as he contemplated. “That… is difficult, yes… very difficult.” He called on his assistants, and they set to work modifying the canon, tinkering with the casing and the damestear within, aligning it perfectly – then, the gnome hooked up a string to a lever at the cannon’s back, and ordered those present to stand no less than 6.1 metres away. After a short countdown, Boltbrass pulled on the string and shouted “Danger-ho!”\n\nThe back of the blaster exploded. Half the artificers ducked for cover – but the Emperor was too transfixed on the magical bolt careening through the sky to care. It impacted the palace atop the Gathyanavaida and blew half of it into the sky. Denariatam’s breath caught – the power of Ebenanth replicated before his eyes. If this was the power of but a few Cannorian artificers, what could the Taychendi do with this technology?"
 taychendi_empire_events.11.a: "“Sando, you’ve won yourself a city. Make me five hundred of these!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.12.t: "The Heart That Feeds?"
 taychendi_empire_events.12.d: "After the wars of the Relic-Lord Kadradar, who unleashed a devastating plague on Andeios, fuelled by fell blood magics that turned elven disease immunity against itself, many Taychendi sought an escape from the chaos of their homeland. It was off the back of a Fateweaver-given prophecy that Darakash Threadsworn set off to the west, establishing a Taychendi “philosopher-kingdom” near Empkeios called Vadhipakvam, where he attempted to integrate Kheionai-inspired thinking into a Taychendi way of viewing the world.\n\nDarakash never truly fulfilled his dreams, however. His expedition had left carnage in its wake, and the incensed Chendhyans rallied against this new invader – not twenty years after its founding, Ultarlan the Decimator destroyed Vadhipakvam. Few Taychendi survived – none made it back home.\n\nBut times have changed. The Chendhya is pacified for good, and we now control the entirety of a land synonymous with philosophical thinking. Many are calling for us to attempt to recreate Darakash’s dream in our Kheionai territories, with this new Vadhipakvam promoting a mix of Taychendi philosophies that will better serve their new subjects – and therefore allow them to better serve our empire. Others still call for us to simply better garrison our Kheionai territories, and attempt to integrate them through might and power, rather than words and reason. Ultimately, the choice is [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s to make."
 taychendi_empire_events.12.a: "This philosopher-vassal will serve us well."
 taychendi_empire_events.12.b: "The Kheionai are better ruled with force. "

 taychendi_empire_events.13.t: "The Hearts that Feed"
 taychendi_empire_events.13.d: "“Can we do it? Well…” a slave passed the Vustarin a series of papers – she rolled them out on the desk, revealing a series of city plans. “The location or supposed location of the Zopedan cores in each of the Kheions – we did a little investigating before Degakheion was agreed upon, just in case, but now that we know what they look like, how you can scrap your way to finding them…? Well, Arpedifér’s core is the only one that still eludes us, but we’ll get there – other than that only problem comes in clearing out the areas we need to excavate.”\n\nDenariatam nodded as he stared at the papers on the meeting table. The moment he laid his eyes on the final figures from the excavation of Degakheion’s windward, his mind was set. The wealth they had dug up from those cities was simply astronomical… how could he resist the opportunity to replicate that success six times over?\n\n“My Emperor?” Denariatam looked up. “I think you’re asking the wrong questions.” The Vustarin Matriarch put Oktikheion’s city-plan to one side, and unravelled a map of the Cleaved Sea. “It isn’t whether we’ve prepared to excavate – it’s if you’ve prepared for what comes next. The Kheionai will rise in revolt… and if I had to guess, it would all Kheionai, everywhere. And the world will look on us like– well, we’d be pariahs for a time, I’m sure.”\n\nThe Emperor furrowed his brow. “I didn’t expect you to question my morality.”\n\n“Not your morality,” the Vustarin pointed at Empkeios on the map, “your troop deployments. Threzaranthi Uyasmar would do more good in Oktikheion than Empkeios, and the Rakulacans… well, let’s just say this is going to take a lot of bloodshed, and they’ve proved good at it.”"
 taychendi_empire_events.13.a: "Look upon my works…"

 taychendi_empire_events.14.t: "Zopedan Completely Disassembled"
 taychendi_empire_events.14.d: "Yesterday, the last of the damestear-alloy conduits that once supported the Windward of Arpedifér was packed up and sent on a ship to Devand – with Arpedifér’s fall, the last of the Kheions has been ransacked. Now, the once mighty centres of Kheionai civilisation lie desolate, now more tombstone than city.\n\nWhen one asks if it was worth it, when one asks if we can lie easy, having destroyed the heart of a civilisation, we may simply point to the mountains of damestear and Precursor-steel dragged up from their depths – worth enough to launch a thousand ships or outfit a hundred-thousand soldiers.\n\nThe Kheions survived the Ruin of Aelantir, survived the withering storm of the Kaydhano, survived strife and war, Kheionai against Kheionai – but they could not withstand our ambition, our pride, our vainglory. Who could?"
