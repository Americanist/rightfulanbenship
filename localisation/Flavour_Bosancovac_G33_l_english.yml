  flavour_bosancovac.551.t:0 "Wendigo Attack"
  flavour_bosancovac.551.d:0 "While on their expedition, the troops are on the lookout for any Cursed Ones lurking in the trees. Unfortunately this meant that they overlooked what they thought was a deer. It turned out to be a wendigo, a large antlered abomination that they had only known roamed in Veykoda."
  flavour_bosancovac.551.a:0 "Abandon a ship to flee."
  flavour_bosancovac.551.b:0 "Stand and fight!"

  flavour_bosancovac.552.t:0 "Escaped"
  flavour_bosancovac.552.d:0 "By sacrificing one of our boats and some of our men, the rest escaped unharmed. Though the encounter left the men chilled for many nights."
  flavour_bosancovac.552.a:0 "It had to be done."

  flavour_bosancovac.553.t:0 "Wendigo Defeated"
  flavour_bosancovac.553.d:0 "At the cost of many men and the ruin of two of our ships, the wendigo was brought low. As is customary, the horns of the wendigo were shorn off in order to be fashioned onto a helmet."
  flavour_bosancovac.553.a:0 "Nice, fancy helmet!"

  flavour_bosancovac.554.t:0 "Found Fork"
  flavour_bosancovac.554.d:0 "After a few months of clashes with Cursed Ones, the expedition came upon a fork in the river. The left path goes around a bend while the right is straight, though a little narrower."
  flavour_bosancovac.554.a:0 "Go Left."
  flavour_bosancovac.554.b:0 "Go Right."

  flavour_bosancovac.555.t:0 "Dead End"
  flavour_bosancovac.555.d:0 "With nothing but more Cursed Ones to show for it, the expedition reached the end of this river, now named the Zabrynn, or dark river, for it has naught around it but the dark forests of the Cursed Ones."
  flavour_bosancovac.555.a:0 "Return to the fork and request reinforcements."
  flavour_bosancovac.555.b:0 "Return home."

  flavour_bosancovac.556.t:0 "Found Lake"
  flavour_bosancovac.556.d:0 "After many long months of fighting off Cursed Ones, the weary expeditionaries find a wonder they had never seen before. Beyond the trees lied an unbelievably big section of the Ynn. So large that one could not see from one end to the other. Paddling across it revealed that it had an end, though the Ynn did not continue past it. They had to turn around, but this was a discovery that made the expedition worthwhile."
  flavour_bosancovac.556.a:0 "Return home."
  flavour_bosancovac.556.b:0 "Return to the fork and request reinforcements."

  flavour_bosancovac.557.t:0 "Expedition Returns"
  flavour_bosancovac.557.d:0 "Low in numbers and down a number of vessels, the expeditionaries return. They come bearing great news of a stretch of the Ynn so wide and long that all you can see is water. With there also being no river past it, the priests of Bosancovac have concluded that this discovery must be the source of the Ynn!"
  flavour_bosancovac.557.a:0 "Those that came back are the envy of all."
