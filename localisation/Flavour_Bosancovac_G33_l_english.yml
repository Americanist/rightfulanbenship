  bosancovac_reconciliation_title:0 "Reconciliation"
  bosancovac_reconciliation_desc:0 "The ongoing struggle over the sovereignty of Malacnar and Amacimst is of no benefit to the parties involved; we need to use other, less hostile means to reign them in. Faced with a conciliatory attitude backed by the full might of Bosancovac, these troublemakers will have no choice other than to accept the generous terms we offer them.\n\nThe Grebniesth Gardens in the north are a very suitable spot to conduct diplomacy and the use of such a venue is sure to leave a good impression on the attending diplomats, helping us further in setting an agreeable mood around the negotiations."

  bosancovac_subdue_the_rabblerousers_title:0 "Subdue the Rabble-Rousers"
  bosancovac_subdue_the_rabblerousers_desc:0 "Bostynn is a hotbed for outlaws and rebels; their efforts have not only destabilized the province, but have bled to the nearby areas as well. We have to get rid of these unfavorable elements by any means necessary! And what better way to quell dissent than to send Peacekeepers of the Guard to end the madness and establish control over the area?"
  bostynn_revolt_tt:0 "Is in a state of revolt."

  bosancovac_repatriate_the_tromseloc_way_title:0 "Repatriate the Tromseloc Way"
  bosancovac_repatriate_the_tromseloc_way_desc:0 "During the disaster that was the fall of the Ynnic Empire, the former province of Trvoselin, along the Tromseloc Way, was ravaged by the Veykodan tribes and wendigo attacks. Now, after a long time, we have the ability to retake a land many of our people regard as their ancestral home. The time for debate is over; now we must act and start the repopulation of this area!"

  bosancovac_reimagining_the_dams_title:0 "Reimagining the Dams"
  bosancovac_reimagining_the_dams_desc:0 "Every civilization worth its weight leaves a trace of its culture and art behind for future generations to study and admire; built by our ancestors, the Ynnic dams are such pieces of cultural brilliance. As our ships pass by the dams, appreciation rises for the guardians who keep the legacy of our forefathers functioning and clean… but is that all there is to our rule?\n\nNo - we must leave our mark on Ynnic culture and history! Let us redecorate these magnificent pieces of architecture in our image, commissioning the brightest and most skilled of our artists and architects to create a façade that reflects the glory of Bosancovac!"

  bosancovac_just_doing_business_title:0 "Just Doing Business"
  bosancovac_just_doing_business_desc:0 "Cannorians are an odd bunch to those unfamiliar with the ways of a merchant, those who fail to get with the times and develop new business strategies - but for the people of Bosancovac? A Cannorian is just like any other buyer waiting to be persuaded.\n\nAs are our own subjects, actually. Their lands still remain behind the times in terms of development. We should use our newly learned Cannorian-inspired business strategies to “invest” in their lands."

  bosancovac_a_gemstone_currency_title:0 "A Gemstone Currency"
  bosancovac_a_gemstone_currency_desc:0 "Our reliance on Vels Domfan minting and book-keeping could prove problematic in the long run, if we seek to rapidly increase the volume of outgoing trade. Recently there has been a debate on this topic, and the consensus seems to be that an alternate currency could be worth the monumental initial investment and effort. The gems of Argezvale, and in particular their rubies, have come up regularly during said debates, and they are certainly worth a strong consideration!"

  bosancovac_technological_showcase_title:0 "Technological Showcase"
  bosancovac_technological_showcase_desc:0 "With advanced metallurgical and faceting methods now commonplace among Bosancovac artisans, we can put all of our technological innovations on show. Catching up technologically with most of our Cannorian neighbors has earned us a certain level of admiration, and we should use our diplomatic prowess in combination with this newly gained attention to set the stage for even bigger leaps in the future. Inviting technologically competent countries to our showcase could be a step in the right direction."

  #Col 2

  bosancovac_a_noble_rivalry_title:0 "A Noble Rivalry"
  bosancovac_a_noble_rivalry_desc:0 "The Noble Realms of Amacimst and Malacnar boast some of Ynn’s best fighters, with their rivalry being just as renowned across the Ynn. To help consolidate our strategic position we must bring this tension to the brink. The threat of our forces joining either side should be enough to force one of them to overthrow the other, as bloody an affair as that might be."

  bosancovac_network_of_faith_title:0 "Network of Faith"
  bosancovac_network_of_faith_desc:0 "With the inevitable rise of Bosancovac, so should rise its benefactors. The Clergy have time and time again proven to be the backbone of our country and if we are to tighten our grip on the region, controlling its faithful through our loyal clergy must be a high priority. With enough political support, our priests will have a much easier time preaching the ways of our faith, and the good we have done for the faithful."

  bosancovac_found_the_city_guard_title:0 "Found the City Guard"
  bosancovac_found_the_city_guard_desc:0 "With Bosancovac now prospering, it is pertinent that we guard it from threats, be it on the outside or the inside. The traditional guardsmen of the city need to receive further investments into their training and equipment projects to bolster our defenses and keep our citizens safe."
  boasncovac_build_garrison_tt:0 "§GUnlock building the Garrison district.§!"

  bosancovac_guidance_of_the_river_title:0 "Guidance of the River"
  bosancovac_guidance_of_the_river_desc:0 "If we are to look outside, first we must make sure that Bosancovac has all the resources it needs to support such an effort. An issue that has come to our attention is that The Temple’s operations require more incense; such a resource has traditionally been sourced from Imstana, but we should utilize the farms under the control of the merchants to secure more incense by increasing productivity in the province and establishing more farms."
  bosancovac_tromseloc_tt:0 "§GYou may restore the Tromseloc Way.§!"

  bosancovac_develop_new_industries_title:0 "Develop New Industries"
  bosancovac_develop_new_industries_desc:0 "Resources of many different kinds and quality now flow through Bosancovac; the city is as lively as ever and the industry is being worked to capacity. However, we should not grow complacent. To further increase the Treasury’s weight we should move away from producing raw resources and opt for manufactured naval supplies such as ropes and lamp oil that will help our merchant fleet in the long run."
  bosancovac_build_warehouse_tt:0 "§GUnlock building the Warehouse district.§!"

  bosancovac_finding_a_niche_title:0 "Finding a Niche"
  bosancovac_finding_a_niche_desc:0 "Having taken an interest in our sturdy ropes and lamp oil, some famed adventuring companies have contacted us and expressed their desire to secure a steady supply of these goods for their guild and crew. Indeed, such quality product is a very useful tool for exploration! Furthermore, our position allows us to act as a middleman between the Cannorians of the Expanse and those in Veykoda, a position to be leveraged as soon as possible!"
  boasncovac_build_foreign_quarter_tt:0 "§GUnlock building the Foreign Quarter district.§!"

  bosancovac_improved_metallurgy_title:0 "Improved Metallurgy"
  bosancovac_improved_metallurgy_desc:0 "If we are to create high quality manufactured goods, we need to be able to source quality material for it. A fundamental piece of this puzzle will always be advanced metal alloys and combinations of different alchemical processes that lead to their creation. It has come to our attention that a particular alloy made of Iron and Copper can result in a very flexible, highly durable product useful for making springs, which could in turn be used in several fields of engineering, such as clock-making. Our resources should be directed at these efforts to pave the way for future industrial and economic growth."
  bosancovac_metallurgy_tt:0 "In up to 10 §YIron§! or §YCopper§! provinces owned by [Root.GetName] or a subject:\n   Gain §G1§! Base Production.\n   Gain §G1.00§! Innovativeness."

  bosancovac_standard_time_clock_terminal_title:0 "Standard Time Clock Terminal"
  bosancovac_standard_time_clock_terminal_desc:0 "Watermills have long been an iconic feature of the Ynn's riverside. However with our advancements in clockwork, improvements could be made to them to incorporate clockwork into their designs. With this increased prevalence of clocks, we will also need a central clock tower in Bosancovac to serve as a standard and accurately coordinate clocks throughout the Ynn."
  bosancovac_clock_tower_tt:0 "Display the Bosancovac Clock Tower §YAmbient Object§!."

  bosancovac_clockwork_city_title:0 "Clockwork City"
  bosancovac_clockwork_city_desc:0 "The Ynn has adopted our standard clock and centered regional time around the clock tower of Bosancovac; now we should take this trend to a new level and truly transform the floating city. The Clockwork city is already a common nickname thrown around, and we shall show everyone what that phrase really means!"
  bosancovac_no_overload_tt:0 "§JBosancovac's foundation become adaptable and will no longer become overloaded.§!"

  #Col 3

  bosancovac_secure_more_materials_title:0 "Secure More Materials"
  bosancovac_secure_more_materials_desc:0 "The Floating City, for all its wonder, has one major weakness: Space. The foundations of the city are old and do not leave much room for expansion without significant revamps and investments. Thankfully we should be able to secure enough lumber on our own. As for actually expanding the foundations, we should contact some experts, and the famed architects of Brelar have been assessed by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as the best candidates. Now only remains the matter of finding these architects and convincing them to take the job…"

  bosancovac_the_gem_of_dolindha_title:0 "The Gem of Dolindha"
  bosancovac_the_gem_of_dolindha_desc:0 "Our capital has already eclipsed the old Ynnic Capital of Vareynn in wealth and size. Further trade flowing through the city and people flocking to its gates is sure to push its status beyond those of Malacnar and Amacimst and make it the Gem of Dolindha!"
  bosancovac_high_dev_tt:0 "Has lower Development than Bosancovac"

  bosancovac_expand_the_merchant_fleet_title:0 "Expand the Merchant Fleet"
  bosancovac_expand_the_merchant_fleet_desc:0 "With a massive increase in Ynn-bound commercial activity, our old infrastructure and logistics are proving more and more inadequate by the day. We must secure additional lumber from the Drevonsred to keep up with the basic needs of our maritime trade."
  bosancovac_better_foundations_tt:0 "\n§GReduce bad events from occuring when constructing foundations for Bosancovac.§!"
  bosancovac_upgrade_trading_ports_tt:0 "\n§GUpgrade our trading ports.§!"

  bosancovac_sway_their_clergy_title:0 "Sway Their Clergy"
  bosancovac_sway_their_clergy_desc:0 "For all their bickering, the decadent lords of Arganynn and Ancovynn are not very popular amongst their people; all they do is scheme against each other and spend time in complacency. If we were to put aside a sizable donation for their temples, we could convince the faithful that we are the true rulers of the Ynn, and that their lords need to be put back in line."
  bosancovac_subject_money_tt:0 "Have at least §Y50.0§!¤ per subject with a province in the Ancovynn or Arganynn groups that does not have §G+200§! opinion of [Root.GetName] or §Y50§! Spy Network from [Root.GetName]."
  bosancovac_cost_tt:0 "[Root.GetName]:"

  bosancovac_rise_of_the_patricians_title:0 "Rise of the Patricians"
  bosancovac_rise_of_the_patricians_desc:0 "The wealthiest of Bosancovac families, also known as The Patricians, already contribute a sizable amount to our nation’s economy. We should increase our ties to these families and keep them close to the court. This way we can incorporate more of them into the government while having a very loyal, very powerful faction at our side, who can provide us with invaluable experience in the matters of state. With their help we shall build a nation that will stand proudly besides the mighty Ynn!"

  bosancovac_formalize_succession_title:0 "Formalize Succession"
  bosancovac_formalize_succession_desc:0 "Choosing a successor for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has always been an informal affair; either the ruling [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] picks a favored candidate or the other priests put forth a suggestion to the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. With a patrician's child as current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] however, it is time to formalize how the succession works. By establishing rules and processes that favor the patricians, they effectively can choose who becomes the next [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
  bosancovac_ruler_tt:0 "Previous ruler died"
  bosancovac_new_ruler_tt:0 "Current ruler is a Merchant's Child."
  bosancovac_succession_tt:0 "Heir selection will now be between the different patrician families.\n"

  bosancovac_centralize_the_temples_title:0 "Centralize the Temples"
  bosancovac_centralize_the_temples_desc:0 "The separation of authority between the Ynnic temples in Svemel, Adbrabohvi, and Bosancovac has caused naught but harm to the harmony of our worship. With Bosancovac now the dominant power of the Ynn, we can afford to change that; all faithful whose presence are graced by the Ynn shall henceforth look to Bosancovac for spiritual guidance!"

  bosancovac_downriver_relations_title:0 "Downriver Relations"
  bosancovac_downriver_relations_desc:0 "In order to ensure that our ferries and other trade ships do not run into problems while sailing to and from the dams, we need to send a friendly delegation to Vels Bacar and keep them on good terms with us. While we’re at it, sending a delegation to Adbrabohvi, the other temple of the Ynn, might be in order to discuss the matters of faith and evaluate their situation."
  bosancovac_free_passage_tt:0 "Receive §Gfree passage§! through the §TVels Bacar§! dam.\n"

  bosancovac_support_the_merchant_fleet_title:0 "Support the Merchant Fleet"
  bosancovac_support_the_merchant_fleet_desc:0 "The reputation of The Holy Merchant Fleet usually precedes its presence in any Ynnic harbor; we need to bolster its capabilities to match that reputation. By convincing the priests to throw in their investments with the merchants, we should be able to secure enough resources to make it happen, and the subsequent commercial benefits are sure to be worth our while!"

  bosancovac_establish_trading_ports_title:0 "Establish Trading Ports"
  bosancovac_establish_trading_ports_desc:0 "To remove route complications and restrictions facing our merchant fleet, we need to establish forward bases and suitable docking sites along the river. This will benefit everyone living in those areas by providing a steady flow of goods provided by our fleet and maximizing trade efficiency on our side."
  bosancovac_mercantilism_gain_tt:0 "Gain §G1§! Mercantilism per country that meets the conditions and lower their Mercantilism by §R5§!."

  bosancovac_revitalized_administration_title:0 "Revitalized Administration"
  bosancovac_revitalized_administration_desc:0 "Having to manage numerous subject lords and courts is a time-consuming and complicated business, something that we cannot handle with our current institutions.

  bosancovac_hostile_takeover_title:0 "Hostile Takeover"
  bosancovac_hostile_takeover_desc:0 "Dolindhan trade is finally within our full dominion! Gone are the days of leasing small ports to host our merchant fleet; with this newfound power, we can turn the Holy Ports into something permanent, a safe harbor for our trade fleet. Moreover, it is important to expand the capabilities of these ports and turn them into maritime districts to support more and more trade traffic."

  bosancovac_remove_the_false_belief_title:0 "Remove the False Belief"
  bosancovac_remove_the_false_belief_desc:0 "To claim godhood is to withstand a god’s test, and how good is a god if dead? Killed by mere mortals nonetheless! Surely, after the demise of that pathetic dragon god of theirs, the people of Rzenta are ready to see the real light in the flow of the Ynn and accept us as its true priests and representatives?"

  bosancovac_cornering_the_market_title:0 "Cornering the Market"
  bosancovac_cornering_the_market_desc:0 "The last region yet to truly open its markets to our fleet is the Sarda. We must remedy that by sending boats there, this time not with goods but with a few men to “convince” them that commerce is not negotiable."

  bosancovac_knights_aboard_title:0 "Knights Aboard"
  bosancovac_knights_aboard_desc:0 "With The Knights Abroad now fully able to coordinate with our regular army, our fighting force is in a prime position to show everyone the true might of Bosancovac! First, however, we need to figure out the matter of the fleet that will work to transport and supply our armies: larger vessels, more transport ships, and more weapons are needed to arm the fleet!"

  bosancovac_expedition_up_vitreynn_title:0 "Expedition Up Vitreynn"
  bosancovac_expedition_up_vitreynn_desc:0 "The dark lands beyond Vitresoln have always been a place of mystery for the inhabitants of the Ynn downstream and with a lack of adequate equipment usually came a lack of large, well-organized expeditions. Our fleet, however, is now equipped with larger ships that can handle such a journey into The Forest of The Cursed Ones, and so we must sail there and see what awaits us!"

  bosancovac_create_a_path_to_the_source_title:0 "Create a Path to the Source"
  bosancovac_create_a_path_to_the_source_desc:0 "The discovery of the source of the Ynn has sent huge ripples throughout Bosancovac, with many wanting us to secure a route there in order to make pilgrimages. While securing a foothold in the Forest of the Cursed Ones will be difficult, we have received reports of strange happenings in the area, and the fear of a third party disturbing something that they do not understand has overcome any reservations that the people held before - we are compelled to investigate even further."
  bosancovac_expedition_tt:0 "The expedition has returned.\n"

  bosancovac_secure_the_lake_title:0 "Secure the Lake"
  bosancovac_secure_the_lake_desc:0 "We have finally made our way back to the source! However, in order for the pilgrims to have a safe journey we must completely secure the area first and root out any attackers or disturbances that may endanger the lives of Ynn’s faithful."

  bosancovac_establish_holy_site_title:0 "Establish the Holy Site"
  bosancovac_establish_holy_site_desc:0 "With a secure route established, now all that needs to be done is to create some infrastructure along the way for pilgrims to stop at. The fork in the river would make for an excellent place to build a hostelry, as it's a halfway point and has good connections via the rivers.\n\nThe holy site will feature an area where pilgrims can enter the source and be cleansed by a priest overseeing the ceremony. Along with this, there will be a great temple overlooking the water with an attached stable for pilgrims to make a trip around the source atop an antler horse. Of course, for these services, the church must collect a tithe from the devout making the trip."

Beyond the trees lied an unbelievably big section of the Ynn. So large that one could not see from one end to the other. Paddling across it revealed that it had an end, though the Ynn did not continue past it. They had to turn around, but this was a discovery that made the expedition worthwhile."
