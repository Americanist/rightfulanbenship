 flavour_isagumze.9.d:0 "Oh Zerat, how glorious must the ancient city have been when it stood as the heart of the great empire of the lizardfolk, and how low it had fallen under the rule of those that refused to admit their time had ended. Nothing more than an old rotten heart that stubbornly keeps beating, futilely trying to delay the unstoppable flow of fate.\n\nBut that ends now, our troops have been let loose in the city, with orders to leave no brick standing on top of another and no lizard spared. When the sacking is over the city will have been purified, the great spire left as the only thing standing intact on top of charred ruins, our bravest soldiers adorned with the scales of its stubborn defenders.\n\nWho can deny our claim to the eternal empire now, when we have torn down the last remnant of the last one?
