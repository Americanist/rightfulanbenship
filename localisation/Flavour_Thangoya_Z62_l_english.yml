 #Missions
 thangoya_1_5_title:0 "Memory of A Sunrise"
 thangoya_1_5_desc:0 "Hiderion may've lost against us, but this does not mean that some of his points were worth implementing. The united townships shall be united not only in name, but also in governance, each having a large amount of influence over the politics of the new state. This of course shall include the elven communities of Azkare, who have enjoyed many liberties since Hiderion took over."
 thangoya_1_6_title:0 "Centuries of Horsemanship"
 thangoya_1_6_desc:0 "If there is one thing Sikai should be known about, it's their Purebred horses. Bred specifically for their speed and strength in stables of Khao Elnak, these steeds are the best in dealing devastating charges to the opponents. Yet on the fields of Lektonmai, the quality of the horses weren't the thing that decided the battle. With both sides riding the Purebreds, it was the Azkarean training that decided the course of the battle. We shall embrace their tactics, taking a new step in the Sikai cavalry doctrine."
 thangoya_1_7_title:0 "Forming New Industries"
 thangoya_1_7_desc:0 "Compared to other areas of the world, Thangoya certainly isn't an industrialized country. Barring Khanvuphaim and Silver, the only thing we can really offer are grain and animals. This needs to change. We shall invest in the establishment of new businesses, prospecting for new resources or looking to use current ones in a new way."
 thangoya_1_9_title:0 "Attract The Artisans"
 thangoya_1_9_desc:0 "While we have managed to create a well working system, the country still lacks establishments ready to handle large scale operations. We need experienced minds to lead our markets. Build Manufactories."
 thangoya_1_10_title:0 "All Citizens Aboard"
 thangoya_1_10_desc:0 "If our country wants to make the leap forward, we need to use everything in our sleeves to execute our plans. The mages of our country have been rather underutilised, so let's employ them for the construction of the large state projects."
 thangoya_1_11_title:0 "To Forge"
 thangoya_1_11_desc:0 "The hills bordering us and Xianjie are known for their large reserves of metals, especially bronze. The extraction of these have been the first and foremost export of the Sikai since the dawn of the first kingdom almost millenias ago. When our country prospect, so did they, remaining on top of the social ladder. Let us give them proper representation and privileges, so that they can fully profit off of their industry as the example of success in the republic."

 thangoya_2_5_title:0 "Funnel The Xia"
 thangoya_2_5_desc:0 "Many denizens of the Xianjie have been escaping their lands fearing the onslaught of the Hobgoblin Command. Let us advertise ourselves in their communities as a safe haven, free from wars and with land ready to settle."

 thangoya_2_6_desc:0 "Actually hell nah, let's proactively just bite a thicc piece of that Wulin pie."

 thangoya_3_6_title:0 "Silver and Bronze"
 thangoya_3_6_desc:0 "The Shield Monks of Lo Pashong and the Silver Shields of Lo Ngoen have shared similar traditions, somehow disconnected from each other. Let us link those traditions to create a steady frontline, that can embrace any charge and outduel their opponents with martial prowess and equipment advantage."
 thangoya_3_7_title:0 "How To Govern"
 thangoya_3_7_desc:0 "Even to its denizens, the dwarven holds are an administrative marvel, housing whole countries in the depths of a single mountain. Surely, similar feats can be done on the lush and fertile lands of Thangoya, right? We only need to know how."
 thangoya_3_9_title:0 "Bartering With Sikhawlom"
 thangoya_3_9_desc:0 "Sikhawlom Desert is a phenomena. A barren desert, standing between lush and fertile grasslands of Hukai and Telebei, occupied by thousands of unknown spirits, eternally grieving an unknown cause, whirlwinding across the desert, their tears turning into salt, which gave the desert its name - White Wind. The druiding circles of Phudban have been researching this spirits for a long time and perhaps with the resources that our state has, they may calm or perhaps banish the spirits and make the land hospitable."
 thangoya_3_10_title:0 "City of Adventurers"
 thangoya_3_10_desc:0 "Haiban has for the longest time the center of Sikai trade and a hub for many packs of adventurers, ones who did not appreciate the bureaucratic and political approach of the Lot Dekkhangi Daulophs.

 thangoya_4_8_title:0 "People Without a State"
 thangoya_4_8_desc:0 "The Phonan have been long living under the oppression of the Baihon Xinh monarchy, time to liberate them and give them space to flourish on their own."
 thangoya_4_9_title:0 "Gate To Thidinkai"

 thangoya_5_9_title:0 "Heavy Duty Cavalry"
 thangoya_5_9_desc:0 "The most distant of the Kai brethren, Binhrung people possess the valuable technology of the gem encrusted armor. Now that they are under our governance, we can merge this technology with what we have now to create the best armor money can buy."
