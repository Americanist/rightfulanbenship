Escann is still a dangerous place."

 escanni_refugees_settlement.401.d:0 "The former inhabitants of these lands return, some happy with what we have achieved, others demanding we return some of their lands and homes. We are the ones in a position of power and whether we return their lands or not they won't have much to say."

 escanni_refugees_settlement.500.t:0 "Result of our refugee policy"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.500.d:0 "The refugee policy that has been in place for a few years has yielded results, it is possible to influence the proceedings but it might be costly."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.500.a:0 "We shall escort them safely to their new home"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.500.b:0 "They are free to go, but we will not help them"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.500.c:0 "Convince and bribe more to depart our lands"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.500.e:0 "Try to better their situation"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.500.f:0 "We welcome our new citizens with open arms"
 
 escanni_refugees_settlement.501.t:0 "A souring relationship"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.501.d:0 "Our relationship with the refugees has soured greatly in the last few years. Some policies we have enacted greatly upset them and now the repercussions can be felt in any refugee settlement. They aren't hostile to us, but they have clearly closed up."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.501.a:0 "We are too blame, but so are they"
 
 escanni_refugees_settlement.502.t:0 "Escanni refugees are growing upset"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.502.d:0 "In whom does the blame lies ? For the Escanni the answer to this is pretty simple. We are to blame, our people, our advisors, our get.ruler.title; for almost everything that happens to them. It's simple really, having someone to blame is really cathartic, sadly this is not for the best. The peace we maintain with the refugees is tenuous at best, but things can get better if we invest in appropriate endeavours, or worse if we discriminate them further."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.502.a:0 "Hopefully they don't cause too much trouble"
 
 escanni_refugees_settlement.503.t:0 "Escanni refugees are outraged"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.503.d:0 "Outrage, unrest, turmoil. Many words describe the current tensions between us and the Escanni. We are on the brink of an irredeemable situation, on the verge of shattering the fragile peace between our peoples. The coming years might be our only chance to right the course, before the impending crisis comes to pass."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.503.a:0 "This is spiralling out of control"
 
 escanni_refugees_settlement.504.t:0 "Escanni refugees grow close to our people"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.504.d:0 "It is a small thing, to hear children laught together while playing, but it is a newfound peace for the Escanni. No longer do the parents in Escanni households tell of stories where our people are the villains, no longer do they teach to be wary of us. No, we both see each other as we are, we both share these lands. And they are welcome here."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.504.a:0 "I drink to our newfound brethren"
 
 escanni_refugees_settlement.505.t:0 "The newfound status-quo"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.505.d:0 "Coldness, that is the one word that can describe the gaze the Escanni give us now. Just cold glares, full indifference and fatigue. This isn't necessarily for the worse, we tolerate each other, and that's a minimum if we desire to live in the same lands."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.505.a:0 "We don't mind their business, they don't mind ours"
 
 escanni_refugees_settlement.506.t:0 "The worst has been avoided"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.506.d:0 "Thanks to policies directed towards pleasing and appeasing the refugees, we have avoided total chaos. This situation is not fixed yet, but we finally have room to breathe. If we want to make the refugees feel at home, there is much work left to do"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.506.a:0 "Indeed, there is much work to do"
 
 escanni_refugees_settlement.507.t:0 "Mass exodus"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.507.d:0 "Long term discrimination and hostility towards the refugees has eroded their trust. Our recent choices have finally broken the status quo, now refugees are leaving in droves, some moving back to Escann other fleeing to neighbouring countries. All we know is that this will be hard, if not impossible, to mend."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.507.a:0 "Curse them"
