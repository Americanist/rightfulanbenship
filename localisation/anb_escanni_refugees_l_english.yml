 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.d:0 "This is the final migration wave of the Escanni, new refugees flood to our lands. The reclamation of Escann now begins, but the refugees might not go back there if they feel at home with us."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.d2:0 "During the Greentide many denizens of Escann fled west, through the efforts of Arbaran and Gawed they were welcomed across western Cannor.\nUntil recently, our realm was not faced with the current refugee crisis. But now that refugees lay in our lands, it is up to us to accommodate them until they can reclaim Escann, if we so desire of course."

 escanni_refugees_settlement.101.d:0 "“Escann Stands”\nThose words are all there is on the lips of town criers and merchants alike. From the window of the meeting room in [This.Capital.GetCapitalName] many common folk and refugees can be seen gathering around one such crier and listening to their tales enraptured.\nInside the meeting room a different scenery is set up, but the matter at hand is the same. An emissary from the [From.GovernmentName] of [From.GetName] stands opposite of [This.Monarch.GetTitle] [This.Monarch.GetName]. His case is simple, he carries with him the following message:\n“Escann Stands, the Greentide is at an end and all those that wish to go to the [From.GovernmentName] of [From.GetName] are welcome to do so!”."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.101.a:0 "The age of the Greentide might be near its end"

Escann is still a dangerous place."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.102.a:0 "Try to convince them to stay"

Famine is on the horizon if we do not act.\nWe must make a decision, one that might be hard, but our people shouldn't starve. Some of our allies might be able to help, if our purse doesn't do the trick of course.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
