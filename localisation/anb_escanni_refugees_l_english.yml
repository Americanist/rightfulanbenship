 # The final flight of the Escanni
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.t:0 "The final flight of the Escanni"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.d:0 "This is the final migration wave of the Escanni, new refugees flood to our lands. The reclamation of Escann now begins, but the refugees might not go back there if they feel at home with us."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.d2:0 "During the Greentide many denizens of Escann fled west, through the efforts of Arbaran and Gawed they were welcomed across western Cannor.\nUntil recently, our realm was not faced with the current refugee crisis. But now that refugees lay in our lands, it is up to us to accommodate them until they can reclaim Escann, if we so desire of course."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.100.a:0 "Only time will tell whether this is a boon or not"

 escanni_refugees_settlement.102.d:0 "The reclamation of Escann has begun in earnest, fledgling states now establish themselves in the abandonned lands in the east.\nMost of them former adventurer bands that fought against the Greentide and now seek to call home the former inhabitants of Escann.\nThey have dispatched messengers across western Cannor, spread the word across travelling merchants, and now many refugees in our lands are packing the little they own to head back to Escann.\n\nShould we help their venture ? Escann is still a dangerous place."
 escanni_refugees_settlement.102.a:0 "Try to convince them to stay"
 escanni_refugees_settlement.102.b:0 "Good riddance"
 escanni_refugees_settlement_102_b_tt:0 "They might not reach Escann"
