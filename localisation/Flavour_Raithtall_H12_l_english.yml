 flavor_raithtall.1.d:0 "This is my most anticipated event to finally write the loc for, and one of the biggest reasons I wanted to make Raithtall/Dorcurt my next MT project. I think i first came up with it sometime in 2023, though it could have been all the way back in 2022. You ask the fey to make you the new guardians of the gate. They're reluctant at first, but then you bring them proof of all the illegal shit the Iadthi nobles poached from the Domandrod. I'm wondering extreme Jhorgas will let me go on this, cosnidering that there's a bunch of animalistic and plantlike fey with human-level sapience that could be hunted and harvested. The fey agree to make you the new guardians, and damn the name of Iadth forever, on th eocndition that you get all the nobles responsible and make them pay."
