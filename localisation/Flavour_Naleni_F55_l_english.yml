 the_riches_of_yetsemira_desc:0 "Yetsemira. One of the greatest cities in all of the Mengi realms, major hub of commerce and trade, rivalled only by Dakmender for its size and wealth. Now Harpies walk her streets and patrol her skies as her rulers, a sight as strange for us as it is for the local humans. There is wealth here however, seen in every fat merchant and laden ship. Wealth almost beyond any single Harpies imagining, and we desire it. \n\nExtracting it will require a radical change in our usual attitudes towards rich traders. Already our port officials are reminding the captains that pull into port that they can’t raid the place anymore (necessary after one incident that left a full fifth of the piers on fire), but for the wealth to truly flow we must show it that we will be suitable custodians. Convincing the people of the justness of our rule, investing into the city and expanding our burgeoning musical arts there will renew Yetsemira as a booming centre of trade. All for the benefit of our purse, of course."

 the_great_songhall_of_yetsemira_title:0 "The Great Songhall"
 the_great_songhall_of_yetsemira_desc:0 "As the Sirens become Semayabaka and song fills the air of our nation, our people, harpy and human like, only ever crave more. Our songhall-temples are spacious, but none is particularly grander than the other, and our most accomplished Sirens and other performers are clamouring for a platform worthy of their skill, one that will draw audiences from across the realm and even further. Private interests have already built some arenas for non-siren performers, but it would not be proper for our elite to be performing in such spaces. Thus we must provide. Yetsemira has become something of a cultural capital in the time since we first developed it, and there we shall build our grand Songhall."

 cutthroat_diplomacy_title:0 "Cutthroat Diplomacy"
 cutthroat_diplomacy_desc:0 "Not all the neighbours are invaders. To the west Boyebareti stands proud as the last Independant Mengi nation on the Gulf Coast. Unfortunately for them, they’re in our way.  We must continue the offensive against the other Raheni colonisers, and their lands block our armies' passage westward along the coast. Whilst we could ferry troops across the waters of the Gulf and bypass Boyebareti lands entirely, doing so would expose us to the same supply vulnerabilities we have been so neatly exploiting in our foe. Perhaps a ‘civilised’ people would simply negotiate military passage, but the humans see us as nothing more than monsters and refuse to have any dealings with us. \n\nSome ‘pragmatic diplomacy’ is called for. Humans have monsters too, and by utilising our criminal connections within Boyebareti, smugglers, thieves, pirates, we can fabricate a pretence for invasion with a support network already in place. Once the area is under our control, there will be no more obstacles to the rest of the coast."

 serenade_our_subjects_title:0 "Serenade our Subjects"
 serenade_our_subjects_desc:0 "Dancing, cheering, drinking. These are not the activities that being near a training hall for fearsome Nalénian Sirens should evoke, and yet our experiences in Tefegben prove otherwise. The local Metebesebi defy all logic in their reactions to our deathly warriors presence and practice, seeing it as entertainment and the song as an unexpected benefit of Harpy rule. \n\nAs strange as this behaviour is, we are nothing if not practical. The Ofehibi humans we now rule in the former lands of Boyebareti have been proving more unruly, and the Matriarch has decided to see whether they respond the same way as their Metobesebi cousins to our Sirens presence. We shall construct a number of new songhalls throughout the region and disperse sirens amongst them, in an attempt at pacification."

 along_the_coast_title:0 "Along the Coast"
 along_the_coast_desc:0 "At last, the colonial heartland of the Raheni is in sight. Here along the Ofehibi coast is where their incursion first began, where they first made landfall, taking Dakmender as their prize. Where it began, and where it shall end. Our prior conquests have taught us the recipe for a successful occupation. Once the coast has been ‘liberated’ from Raheni hands, we will establish our songhalls and begin the pacification of the local Mengi. The Metobesebi have so far proved to be the most amenable to our rule, and so by promoting their cultural values over the other Mengi peoples we can solidify our rule. \n\nThe independent captains will no doubt be disgruntled by the end of the Raheni shipping and the subsequent drop in trade to plunder, but no matter. A monopoly on the Mengi coast will force all trade through our ports, making us far far richer in the long run. Why work for our gold when it could simply come to us?"

 song_for_the_people_title:0 "Music for the Masses"
 song_for_the_people_desc:0 "If the Conclave Tragedy has taught us anything, it's that loyalty is a precious thing. If our own people can betray the Matriarchy, then what of the humans we rule? Do they go to bed at night plotting treason too? \n\nFear is how we have ruled in the past, fear of raids, fear of the hunt, fear of our Sirens, but perhaps there is another way. Perhaps loyalty, however precious, can be made. We have seen how the humans enjoy our song, how they pay their hard won coin just for the chance to see our Sirens perform, enthralled by their beauty and voice. There is only one thing the Humans seem to pay more reverence to, their God, and this is a connection that is exploitable. We shall begin to put on religious services for the humans, combining our song with their faith into hymns, establishing ourselves as a part of it - integral to the faith. \n\n For an avian race the Sky Domain faith is rather flattering..."

 harpy_homelands_title:0 "Harpy Homelands"
 harpy_homelands_desc:0 "The Telekenid mountain range has been our home for over four hundred years. Its lofty heights and rocky precipices made it feel like it was made for us, even to those first Harpies who fled the fall of Siaden and arrived here. But our mountains stretch much further than the territory that we control, even after our conquest. They run deep into Madrimillak, encompassing a full third of the Mengi realm. \n\nAny Empire must establish a firm grip over its core territories, so we shall sweep across the mountains and replace the humans who think they rule here. Then to cement our dominance we shall build our statues amongst the rock, far higher than humans could ever hope to build, so they may look up and remember we are closest to the skies."

 from_above_to_those_beneath_title:0 "From Above, to below"
 from_above_to_those_beneath_desc:0 "Conquest of the Telekenid has cemented our rule over a full third of Madrimillak, and an almost countless amount of the Mengi. Cementing our rule through utilising faith has been an incredibly expedient policy for us so far, our Sirens have begun to develop into a true priest class of their own right supplementing the existing Semayabaka, and humans in our realm pay deference to them. Worship of Amilak through song has spread somewhat beyond our borders, whilst many harpies have even begun converting to Sky Domain in earnest, seeing the natural appeal in a faith of the sky. \n\nWhether the Matriarchy itself adopts Sky Domain as its faith in truth is irrelevant, what matters is that spreading our ways of worship helps us consolidate our control over our new subjects. Thus we shall expand the Sirens' influence, constructing our Songhall-temples throughout the Telekenid, providing a unity of faith the Mengi have not seen since the days of Zenidir and Melakmengi."

 a_new_kind_of_mezhimezhi_title:0 "A new kind of Mezhi'Mezhi"
 a_new_kind_of_mezhimezhi_desc:0 "The Mengi realms have not seen unity since the days of Melakmengi, the empire of the great dragon Zenidir. In those times he was known as Mezhi’Mezhi, king of kings or ruler of rulers, and such a mantle has not been held before or since. \n\nThe prosperity we have ushered into the Telekenid and the increasing importance of Sky Domain in our realm has led to many of our subjects calling for us to attempt to unify Amilak’s domain once more, harpies and humans alike. In particular Siren Semayabaka, true converts to Sky Domain, have been pushing for the state to act, claiming that our people have been chosen by Amilak to restore his realm. \n\nBe it Amilak’s will or not, we shall unify Mengi again. In the Senidmot crater, grave of the dragon, we shall build a new throne and proclaim our monarch Mezhi’Mezhi, Queen of Queens - equal to Zenidir himself!"

 all_hands_on_deck_title:0 "All Hands on Deck"
 all_hands_on_deck_desc:0 "When the Raheni first invaded Sarhal, we were salivating. All those valuable goods, gems, ivory, gold, all packed onto ships and sailed back to Rahen - it was a buffet, a feast for hungry pirates. The independent captains still see it this way, they have grown fat and lazy preying on Rahen’s scraps. \nThe Matriarch knows better. \nIn the decade since the invasion first began, we have been surrounded, and now Rahen eyes our lands too. All whilst the Raheni have grown wealthy beyond the wildest dreams of any Harpy. They must be resisted, our hands brought to arms, and perhaps the flow of wealth reversed..."

 a_southern_roost_title:0 "A Southern Roost"
 a_southern_roost_desc:0 "Not since the days of Siadenlen, long before we came to Sarhal, have we ruled over so many humans as now. Our campaign against the Raheni has put many many more humans under our dominion, and already the gaps in our means of rule are beginning to show. Without the presence of Harpies nearby the local humans seem to almost forget they’ve been conquered! \n\nThe Matriarch has a plan to alleviate this by constructing a new roost in our southern lands, along with a new songhall for our Sirens. Relocating some of our people there will enable us to project control over the region, benevolently giving the local humans the privilege of being abducted to serve as husbands. Not to mention listening to our beautiful melodies."

 land_ho_title:0 "Land Ho"
 land_ho_desc:0 "Rahen, the land of the Raj, the porcelain cities, ivory, silks and slaves. Boundless wealth can be found here, trickling down the Kharunyana into the Gulf. The wealthy Raheni trade states think this wealth is their birthright, the fruits of their lands. They see Sarhal as little more than a resource pit, a continent ripe for exploitation. How wrong they are. \n\nThe first step in our plan shall be establishing a beachhead in Rahen, a little colony of our own to serve as a gateway for further expansion, and enable us to begin to syphon the wealth of Rahen back to Sarhal."

 conclave_of_captains_title:0 "Conclave of Captains"
 conclave_of_captains_desc:0 "It is time to resolve our divisions. This conflict between Captain and Matriarch can not continue any longer. The strife stifles our ambitions. Effort spent in appeasing our own is effort not spent externally, and the Captain's incessant squabbling drains the attention and resources of our state. \n\nWe shall hold a conclave, every independent Captain of note shall be summoned to attend a meeting with the Matriarch and her entire clan in the capitol. Here we shall hash out our differences peacefully. Afterall, are we not all Nalénian?"

 crush_the_mutineers_title:0 "Crush the Mutineers"
 crush_the_mutineers_desc:0 "To secure our reformed state we must be efficient and ruthless. The rebels must be crushed wherever they appear, their forces disintegrated like we have done to so many others already. Though it is painful to spill the blood of our own, they forfeited any kinship when they turned against the Matriarchy. The deaths of our former Matriarch and her entire clan are on their hands, bodies so reduced to ash that we could not even sail them to their final rest. Only once they are defeated will our new monarchy be secure. Only once they are crushed will this wrong be righted."

 privateers_not_pirates_title:0 "Privateers, not Pirates"
 privateers_not_pirates_desc:0 "So called ‘civilised’ peoples are eminently confusing. They engage in much the same behaviour on the sea’s as we, raiding shipping lanes and trade convoys, yet when confronted they produce tiny slips of paper signed by their rulers with a scribble that they claim makes them a “privateer”, not a pirate. \n\nAs ridiculous a precedent as this may be, it can be of great use to us. By formalising privateering and granting licence to captains from the Queen to act as privateers, we can tie their loyalty firmly to the state. Any captains acting out of line will be disavowed and denied access to our ports, absolving us of responsibility for them and creating incentive to keep them in line."

 a_new_naleni_title:0 "A New Naléni"
 a_new_naleni_desc:0 "Naléni shall be reborn under our Queendom, no longer rent apart by division, no longer a monstrous realm on the edge of civilization. We have already proven our might through our conquests, and proven our resilience through our internal struggles. The only thing left to prove is our Majesty. \n\nWe will construct a grand palace, a monument to the Queen that has led us through this time of trouble. From there, we shall make the humans, the harimari, and all others who question take notice. Naléni the pirate haven no more, now and henceforth; Ríva Naléni, proud empire of the Gulf!"

 across_the_gulf_desc:0 "Our state is secure, our armies and fleets ready. The dreams of the Matriarchy will be realised, we shall sail across the Gulf and claim the coasts of Rahen as our own, a mocking mirror of their own actions. We shall say we are there for justice, for revenge or whatever the like, but the truth is we go to Rahen for gold. As the riches flow back to Sarhal their merchants will come to curse the day they ever crossed the Gulf."

 to_rule_the_sea_desc:0 "“Power comes from the point of a sword and the barrel of a cannon.” - Queen Ríva of Naléni \n\nBeneath the false smiles and shook hands of diplomacy, the paper and ink of bureaucracy, the world runs on might. To rule our Empire, now stretching across two continents and the seas between, we must have might comparable to our glory. \n\nOur fleets and army both must expand to capacity, available resources put into training and construction efforts so that our will may be felt on every shore of the Gulf. The Sirens too must be expanded even further, their martial traditions not neglected even despite their growing role in the Mengi Faith. To rule the sea there must be nowhere that the Naléni flag might not be seen over the horizon."

Never before have such heights been reached, peoples of disparate cultures and beliefs brought together under one flag - our flag.\n\nBesides our authority there is only one thing that unifies our realm, one thing that allows our reach to stretch so far - the Gulf. Our beloved home sea, the taste of its salty waters forever on the lips of each Nalénian. Our sea has long been known as the Gulf of Rahen, reflective of the Raheni’s disproportionate influence over it, but no longer. To crown our new age our Gulf shall have a new, better name - the Naléni Gulf, a name enforced by our utter hegemony."

 the_sirens_title:0 "The Sirens"
 the_sirens_desc:0 "Singing on our ships has long been an important way of raising morale and keeping work in rhythm. Some amongst us however have discovered that song can be much more than that, and have worked to hone their song into a potent weapon. Many a human sailor has last heard an entrancing tune before a Siren descends upon them, stupefying them even as their ship is raided. Others hear deathly shrieks that split the eardrum and cut to the core, making the hardiest of hands drop their blades in fear and shock. \n\nCountless Iyarhashari invaders learnt these facts through first hand experience in our recent war, and the Matriarch has taken notice of their effectiveness as a combat unit. We shall begin to formalise the Sirens as an elite unit by constructing a specialised training area funded by the Matriarch. This will provide us with a new source of quality soldiers, ones with the helpful feature of being uniquely loyal to the Matriarchy."

 raiding_bases_title:0 "Raiding Ports"
 raiding_bases_desc:0 "It is more apparent than ever that our command over the sea is our strength. As our mainland ports have multiplied so too has our fleet, both that of the Matriarchy and the independent captains who owe us their allegiance, however our expansion has created a new issue. Captains now whine to the Matriarch about slender pickings to be found in our home waters, forcing them to travel further afield for the same chance at loot, all caused by the reduction in Raheni shipping. \n\nThe Matriarch could of course not care less about the purses of these unruly rebels, but they do raise a real problem. Since settling in Sarhal much of our economy has been based on the lucrative gold stream of piracy, and without new sources of plunder we risk falling destitute as a nation. Luckily the gulf has no shortage of riches to loot, we simply need to access them. By building new ports on islands throughout the Gulf we can extend the range of our raiders, unlocking new coasts ripe for pillaging."

 repurpose_the_slave_port_title:0 "Repurpose the Slave Port"
 repurpose_the_slave_port_desc:0 "The wandering Harimari of Vandipa were long a thorn on our coast. Slavers through and through, their ships sought to contest ours in our very home waters to ensure the safety of their shipping. Not that we even wanted to raid their dingy rat infested boats - slaves are terrible plunder, they eat all the food and are impossible to sell smoothly. \n\nTheir island however is quite the little prize, well developed and full of wealth made off the back of said slave trade, not to mention well positioned off the mainland coast. Now that it belongs to us, it can be put to more appropriate use. Vandipa will be no mere raiding port however, it shall serve us as a gateway to the southern isles, the slaving infrastructure repurposed to colonial ends. Once the Harimari are gone, that is."

 pillage_and_plunder_title:0 "Pillage and Plunder"
 pillage_and_plunder_desc:0 "The humans have a saying, “it's important to remember your roots”. \n\nNo matter how we might advance or who and where we might conquer, at heart we are pirates. Pillage and plunder is in our blood, the thrill of a raid is something every Nalénian has felt, the sway of a ship on the waves, the rush of looting, the satisfaction of a grand haul. These things call to us, and we will never forget them, or our heritage. \n\nWe must make sure the rest of the Gulf doesn't either."

 professionalise_the_sirens_title:0 "Professionalise the Sirens"
 professionalise_the_sirens_desc:0 "Until now our armies have been ragtag bands of harpy warriors together in loose organisation only, serving the matriarchy out of no true loyalty, fighting with ferocity and courage, but no real discipline or order. The Sirens are something of an exception, fiercely loyal to the Matriarch, now Throne, but even they have been more of a levy force, each hall its own unit, with a lack of overarching structure. \n\nThis must change, and it shall start with the Sirens. Queen Ríva’s ideas will serve as our plans for the new Sirens, a fully professional force, a true elite standing army. One that our foes will quake to see descend upon them, transfixed by song and unable to react as our wings block the sun."

 further_afield_title:0 "Further Afield"
 further_afield_desc:0 "Naval logistics are always difficult, given it involves managing thousands of moving pieces on a surface that itself shifts, but they are immensely easier when there exists the state apparatus to properly catalogue items: bases, ships, and supplies. The centralisation of our state and the transformation of our pirate flotillas into a real stratified navy has thus unlocked the potential to extend our influence far beyond our current waters, now that our logistical capability can support such expansion. \n\nThe waters of Tanizu and the Yanshen will soon come to know the sight of our flag upon the masts of our ships. Know it and fear it."

 beyond_the_stormwall_title:0 "Beyond the Stormwall"
 beyond_the_stormwall_desc:0 "The great storm has parted, beyond it a vast new continent. A continent untouched by the larger world, a continent with wealth to be had. Though Insyaa is large, our preliminary exploration has revealed an area to the north of the continent that features a large archipelago. This extensive chain of islands appears to be predominantly inhabited by groups of humans, and there is existing extensive maritime trade. \n\nWere we still pirates, this discovery would have begun a new golden age of piracy. Given that we are now much more respectable privateers, instead it shall begin a new golden age of privateering. The Empire shall move its navy into the region to claim dominance over the trade here, a much appreciated source of new revenue. Bases will be required in order for the fleet to operate so far from our home waters, luckily there are many smaller islands in the region that would be ideal locations."

 an_insyaan_capitol_title:0 "An Insyaan Capitol"
 an_insyaan_capitol_desc:0 "Kanolowele has proven to be a particularly fruitful region for our expansion, however its distance from the core of our Empire is still causing issues. The long trip over the seas makes communication slow even when sending messages via our fastest clippers, with magical communication being the only real viable means of quick connection. \n\nThis results in many logistical and operational issues, with our bases in Insyaa having to act as functionally autonomous for large periods. Clearly this state of affairs cannot continue if we want to expand our influence in the region further. In order to remedy this, we shall embrace the idea of local authority and construct a capitol building from which delegates may exercise rule of the region. Delegates sent from the capital of course. The volcano of Muatlaqua, sacred to the local faiths, will serve as a perfect location."

 new_fleets_title:0 "New Fleets"
 new_fleets_desc:0 "As our domain grows, so too do our needs. Patrolling every inch of coast has become a much more arduous task with our recent expansion, and the development of our new raiding ports has opened many new ‘markets’ for our ships. Our influence and control over the gulf is growing immensely, and to retain that control our fleets must grow in kind."

 new_bases_title:0 "New Bases"
 new_bases_desc:0 "Land, ports, fleets. Our expansion continues and with it comes new opportunities. There are many ‘uninhabited’ islands in the ringlet sea and beyond, islands that pirates frequent as havens to stash treasure and rest. These islands, both the Twilight isles and the Ringlet isles will serve as excellent platforms for our continued naval expansion, allowing our ships the range to raid along the Vimdatrong and southern Sarhal coasts."
