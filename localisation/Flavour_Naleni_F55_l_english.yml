 the_riches_of_yetsemira_desc:0 "Yetsemira. One of the greatest cities in all of the Mengi realms, major hub of commerce and trade, rivalled only by Dakmender for its size and wealth. Now Harpies walk her streets and patrol her skies as her rulers, a sight as strange for us as it is for the local humans. There is wealth here however, seen in every fat merchant and laden ship. Wealth almost beyond any single Harpies imagining, and we desire it. \n\nExtracting it will require a radical change in our usual attitudes towards rich traders. Already our port officials are reminding the captains that pull into port that they can’t raid the place anymore (necessary after one incident that left a full fifth of the piers on fire), but for the wealth to truly flow we must show it that we will be suitable custodians. Convincing the people of the justness of our rule, investing into the city and expanding our burgeoning musical arts there will renew Yetsemira as a booming centre of trade. All for the benefit of our purse."

 cutthroat_diplomacy_desc:0 "Not all the neighbours are invaders. To the west Boyebareti stands proud as the last Independant Mengi nation on the Gulf Coast. Unfortunately for them, they’re in our way.  We must continue the offensive against the other Raheni colonisers, and their lands block our armies' passage westward along the coast. Whilst we could ferry troops across the waters of the Gulf and bypass Boyebareti lands entirely, doing so would expose us to the same supply vulnerabilities we have been so neatly exploiting in our foe. Perhaps a ‘civilised’ people would simply negotiate military passage, but the humans see us as nothing more than monsters and refuse to have any dealings with us. \n\nSome ‘pragmatic diplomacy’ is called for. Humans have monsters too, and by utilising our criminal connections within Boyebareti, smugglers, thieves, pirates, we can fabricate a pretence for invasion with a support network already in place. Once the area is under our control, there will be no more obstacles to the rest of the coast."

 serenade_our_subjects_title:0 "Serenade our Subjects"
 serenade_our_subjects_desc:0 "Dancing, cheering, drinking. These are not the activities that being near a training hall for fearsome Nalénian Sirens should evoke, and yet our experiences in Tefegben prove otherwise. The local Metebesebi defy all logic in their reactions to our deathly warriors presence and practice, seeing it as entertainment and the song as an unexpected benefit of Harpy rule. \n\nAs strange as this behaviour is, we are nothing if not practical. The Ofehibi humans we now rule in the former lands of Boyebareti have been proving more unruly, and the Matriarch has decided to see whether they respond the same way as their Metobesebi cousins to our Sirens presence. We shall construct a number of new songhalls throughout the region and disperse sirens amongst them, in an attempt at pacification."

 along_the_coast_title:0 "Along the Coast"
 along_the_coast_desc:0 "At last, the colonial heartland of the Raheni is in sight. Here along the Ofehibi coast is where their incursion first began, where the INSERT NAME HERE first made landfall, taking Dakmender as their prize. Where it began, and where it shall end. Our prior conquests have taught us the recipe for a successful occupation. Once the coast has been ‘liberated’ from Raheni hands, we will establish our songhalls and begin the pacification of the local Mengi. The Metobesebi have so far proved to be the most amenable to our rule, and so by promoting their cultural values over the other Mengi peoples we can solidify our rule. \n\nThe independent captains will no doubt be disgruntled by the end of the Raheni shipping and the subsequent drop in trade to plunder, but no matter. A monopoly on the Mengi coast will force all trade through our ports, making us far far richer in the long run. Afterall, why work for our gold when it could simply come to us?"

 all_hands_on_deck_desc:0 "When the Raheni first invaded Sarhal, we were salivating. All those valuable goods, gems, ivory, gold, all packed onto ships and sailed back to Rahen - it was a buffet, a feast for hungry pirates. The independent captains still see it this way, they have grown fat and lazy preying on Rahen’s scraps. \nThe Matriarch knows better. \nIn the decade since the invasion first began, we have been surrounded, and now Rahen eyes our lands too. All whilst the Raheni have grown wealthy beyond the wildest dreams of any Harpy. They must be resisted, our hands brought to arms, and perhaps the flow of wealth reversed..."

 a_southern_roost_desc:0 "Not since the days of Siadenlen, long before we came to Sarhal, have we ruled over so many humans as now. Our campaign against the Raheni has put many many more humans under our dominion, and already the gaps in our means of rule are beginning to show. Without the presence of Harpies nearby the local humans seem to almost forget they’ve been conquered! \n\nThe Matriarch has a plan to alleviate this by constructing a new roost in our southern lands, along with a new songhall for our Sirens. Relocating some of our people there will enable us to project control over the region, benevolently giving the local humans the privilege of being abducted to serve as husbands. Not to mention listening to our beautiful melodies."

 the_sirens_title:0 "The Sirens"
 the_sirens_desc:0 "Singing on our ships has long been an important way of raising morale and keeping work in rhythm. Some amongst us however have discovered that song can be much more than that, and have worked to hone their song into a potent weapon. Many a human sailor has last heard an entrancing tune before a Siren descends upon them, stupefying them even as their ship is raided. Others hear deathly shrieks that split the eardrum and cut to the core, making the hardiest of hands drop their blades in fear and shock. \n\nCountless Iyarhashari invaders learnt these facts through first hand experience in our recent war, and the Matriarch has taken notice of their effectiveness as a combat unit. We shall begin to formalise the Sirens as an elite unit by constructing a specialised training area funded by the Matriarch. This will provide us with a new source of quality soldiers, ones with the helpful feature of being uniquely loyal to the Matriarchy."

 raiding_bases_title:0 "Raiding Bases"
 raiding_bases_desc:0 "It is more apparent than ever that our command over the sea is our strength. As our mainland ports have multiplied so too has our fleet, both that of the Matriarchy and the independent captains who owe us their allegiance, however our expansion has created a new issue. Captains now whine to the Matriarch about slender pickings to be found in our home waters, forcing them to travel further afield for the same chance at loot, all caused by the reduction in Raheni shipping. \n\nThe Matriarch could of course not care less about the purses of these unruly rebels, but they do raise a real problem. Since settling in Sarhal much of our economy has been based on the lucrative gold stream of piracy, and without new sources of plunder we risk falling destitute as a nation. Luckily the gulf has no shortage of riches to loot, we simply need to access them. By building new ports on islands throughout the Gulf we can extend the range of our raiders, unlocking new coasts ripe for pillaging."

 repurpose_the_slave_port_title:0 "Repurpose the Slave Port"
 repurpose_the_slave_port_desc:0 "The wandering Harimari of Vandipa were long a thorn on our coast. Slavers through and through, their ships sought to contest ours in our very home waters to ensure the safety of their shipping. Not that we even wanted to raid their dingy rat infested boats - slaves are terrible plunder, they eat all the food and are impossible to sell smoothly. \n\nTheir island however is quite the little prize, well developed and full of wealth made off the back of said slave trade, not to mention well positioned off the mainland coast. Now that it belongs to us, it can be put to more appropriate use. Vandipa will be no mere raiding port however, it shall serve us as a gateway to the southern isles, the slaving infrastructure repurposed to colonial ends. Once the Harimari are gone, that is."

 pillage_and_plunder_desc:0 "The humans have a saying, “it's important to remember your roots”. \n\nNo matter how we might advance or who and where we might conquer, at heart we are pirates. Pillage and plunder is in our blood, the thrill of a raid is something every Nalénian has felt, the sway of a ship on the waves, the rush of looting, the satisfaction of a grand haul. These things call to us, and we will never forget them, or our heritage. \n\nWe must make sure the rest of the Gulf doesn't either."
