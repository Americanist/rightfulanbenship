One weak ruler might shatter all the works of his illustrious forefathers and bring ruin to his people. But not glorious Karqašlu! We are blessed with an eternal Akalunakal - an Emperor Evermore! The strong hands, keen mind and wise heart of Alušir will forevermore guide us into a resplendent future, no matter whose face he happens to wear and with whose voice he announces his commands"

 F30_sunriders_ride_title:0 "Sunriders ride for Us"
 F30_sunriders_ride_desc:0 "The practice of magic has been the birthright of the Bulwari ever since the Šedu sultans had been bound by Brasan the Emancipator and his disciples. However, since the prohibition on the use of magic by humans enacted by the Phoenix empress Jexis the myriad proud traditions of Bulwari magic have been either secluded like the Wishcrafters of Mount Lazzaward, heavily regulated and under the control of the temples like the Exorcist-priests, adopted by elven magicians or forced underground like the szal-Fazil of the far Salahad and Dartaxâgerdim. One of these traditions are the Sarraka or Sunriders, mounted warrior mages originating from Kumarkand who once fought for Jaher even in far Haless. Now composed of elven mages sent as reinforcements from the Varamhari court with a talent for magic and a passion for horse riding, they currently are little more than a ceremonial honour guard for local nobility. Let us approach them in secret and persuade them to switch allegiance from the Varamhari, who treat them as little more than entertaining relics of a past era, to their new homeland and to support our cause instead in return for the restoration of their honourable role as Kumarkands defenders."
 
 F30_rumour_spiral_title:0 "Rumour Spiral"
 F30_rumour_spiral_desc:0 "Lately the rumours swirling in the streets of Apaškumar are even more colourful than usual and travel with an even more frenzied speed. \n\n ‘The Akal is planning to march on Varamhar on the morrow!’ \n\n ‘The Akal is a spineless fool who wants to hand over the throne to Karodir!’ \n\n The usually steady pulse of the city has reached a fever pitch. And in this climate of rumours and distrust comes a summons for the Akal to present himself before the throne of Varamhar. Will he navigate these treacherous waters safely or will this invitation be the spark that ignites the powder keg of rebellion?"
 
 F30_harpy_skies_title:0 "Eyes on the Skies"
 F30_harpy_skies_desc:0 "Since time immemorial, our people have been forced to keep a watchful eye out for the winged threat from the north. It is our duty to not only guard our borders and keep our people safe but to deal with this threat permanently. Whether with open hands and pleasing words or a hidden dagger and cunning ploys, we will pacify the lands of Ayarallen."
 
 F30_acesening_heights_title:0 "Ascending the Heights"
 F30_acesening_heights_desc:0 "If history has taught us anything it is not enough to merely keep the darkness at bay but to fight back and bring the light to dark places. To ensure lasting peace and secure our lands the strength of the harpy matriarchs has to be broken. It is our duty to free our Gelkali brethren from the yoke of winged tyrants. Let us march forward and bring Surakels light even to the most remote mountain vale."
 
 F30_kings_and_feathers_title:0 "Valleys of Kings and Feathers"
 F30_kings_and_feathers_desc:0 "Over two and a half millennia ago Batur III, the last valiant heir of ancient Karqašlu, lost his life in these craggy hills and deep valleys battling the rising might of the harpy queens. Now he is finally avenged! Kumarkand has been victorious and the feathered queens bow before the throne of our Akal."
 
 F30_winged_bulwari_title:0 "Winged Bulwari"
 F30_winged_bulwari_desc:0 "Harpies, one of the scourges of ancient Bulwar that sparked terror in the hearts of lonely travellers and shepherds have at long last become just one more colourful thread in the rich fabric of bulwari society. And like their winged inhabitants, the rugged former realm of the harpy queens is now part of Surakels garden and prospers under the benevolent rule of our Akal."
 
 F30_eyes_moons_title:0 "Eyes on the Moons"
 F30_eyes_moons_desc:0 "After we have turned the former queendoms of the harpies from a constant threat on our northern border to loyal vassals of our realm, it was only natural to turn our gaze to the remaining uplands to our north. Be it by force of arms or eloquent diplomacy, the inhabitants of these lands, be they harpy, human, elf or goblin, have at last become subjects of our glorious Akalate. Now we need to ensure that these remote provinces remain firmly in our grasp. Let us establish a border guard in the Šad Kuz, the mountains of the moon, to ensure that any spark of rebellion is swiftly snuffed out."
 
 F30_ituqattar_resplendent_title:0 "Ituqattar Resplendent"
 F30_ituqattar_resplendent_desc:0 "The culling of the Ituqattar is but a distant memory now, and our proud charioteers are once again at the vanguard of our armies and inspire awe in the hearts of our subjects in all corners of the empire. Recent reports from our new holdings in Bahar tell of elephant herds roaming through the forested hills. This has caught the attention of our glorious Akalunakal who has come up with an ambitious plan. Massive war chariot platforms drawn not by horses but by elephants! Enormous training facilities and housing for the animals will of course have to be built, but with the resources of an empire at hand this is a simple matter of logistics. The Ituqattar are ready to enter a new age of glory - let them strike fear in the hearts of our enemies! Let the resplendent Ituqattar advance!"
 
 F30_talk_whispers_title:0 "Talk and Whispers"
 F30_talk_whispers_desc:0 "The palace in Apaškumar has seen a steady stream of visitors, from provincial nobles to influential merchants and foreign dignitaries in the last couple of months. While palace officials assure everyone that this is merely business as usual and a sign of our beloved Akal fulfilling the duties entrusted to him by our benevolent overlords in Varamhar, the whispers will not stop that maybe he is not that enamoured with the reality of being subservient to another ruler and might plan to do something about it."
 
 F30_wise_king_title:0 "Wise King"
 F30_wise_king_desc:0 "Taelarios Irrliazuir is a steadfast ruler and one of the most influential theologians of the Sun Cult, seen by many as the ultimate arbiter in matters of faith. A ruler blessed with such wisdom will surely see the injustice in the subjugation of Kumarkand under the heel of the vainglorious Varamhari. We might discreetly try to approach him and petition him to support our struggle for independence. And once we have shaken off the yoke of our overlords, who would begrudge Irrliam the gift of a part of our surplus harvest which otherwise would have vanished as tribute down the voracious maw of Varamhar."
 
 F30_manor_lords_title:0 "Manor Lords"
 F30_manor_lords_desc:0 "While the elven Ralkadezim lords of Sareyand in their palatial country estates are just as haughty and overbearing as our Varamhari overlords, they have the distinct benefit of being suitably distracted by threats gnollish and otherwise arising from the deserts in the south and east. Even if they would be tempted to replace our current masters, they simply lack the means, at least for the moment. Therefore it might be in our best interests to swallow our pride for a while and appeal to their inflated sense of importance in return for the palpable benefits that Sareyandi patronage would mean for our troops."
 
 F30_marching_coin_title:0 "Marching for Coin"
 F30_marching_coin_desc:0 "Many heroic tales and epic hymns have been written that praise the loyalty of warriors and their willingness to fight even to their death for Akal and country. But as any cunning ruler can confirm, an army marches on its stomach and while undying loyalty should be treasured, it is a rare commodity indeed, and an acceptable facsimile can be purchased with enough coin. Let us gather the most promising rangers, sellswords and hirelings in our lands in a mercenary army to bolster our forces and deny our enemies the opportunity to purchase their services instead."
 
 F30_greater_kumarkand_title:0 "Greater Kumarkand"
 F30_greater_kumarkand_desc:0 "Kumarkand, not Bulwar or Irrliam, is the true heart of the fertile plains between Suran and Buranun. Let us proclaim a greater Kumarkand, a fitting homeland for our valiant people! Let even the lowest of peasants take pride in the knowledge that in his veins runs the blood of mighty conquerors and wise rulers!"
 
 F30_middle_brother_title:0 "Middle Brother"
 F30_middle_brother_desc:0 "Just as Apaškumar was founded by the Qašnitu of old and Arašbar has been erected by the ancient Akalites, so too does Anzabad bear the distinction of being founded by another group of nomadic invaders, the sea people or Abadi, who came to these lands only to find the shores of the Divenhal bereft of inhabitants after the ordeal of the Onslaught and ripe for resettling. Therefore many call Anzabad the Middle Brother to Kumarkands Older and Arašbars Younger Brother. It is only fitting that we turn our Middle Brother into one of our principal sea ports, now that Anzabad is ours."
 
 F30_city_desire_title:0 "City of Our Desire"
 F30_city_desire_desc:0 "Oh Brasan! The Eternal Home, Bazaar of Halann, Port of Emperors! Many have desired to claim you for their own over the millenia, but you are now the gleaming pearl in the crown of Kumarkand! Every Kumarkandi child has grown up with the tale of how the mighty Karqašlu empire conquered Brasan and put an end to the god king on his coral throne, only to lose this prize due to Elikhet’s treachery. Brasan is truly the City of Our Desire as it was called in the old tales, and now that it is ours, we will slake our desire and enjoy the luxuries brought by ships from a hundred nations to our shores."
 
 F30_sadnatu_riches_title:0 "Sadnatu Riches"
 F30_sadnatu_riches_desc:0 "The forbidding sight of the austere mountains of the sun rising up from the barren shore along the far eastern end of the Divenhal has deceived many visitors into believing that nothing of value could be found in its steep canyons and jagged heights. But as both the human Šadnatu who inhabit their unforgiving homeland at the border to the sunburnt Salahad since time immemorial and the gnollish invaders that plague these lands can attest, the wealth of the Šad Sur lies not in fertile fields and rich pastures above ground, but in the immense mineral wealth below its ochre surface. As we are now in control of these mountains let us make sure that these riches are no longer untapped but instead flow into our coffers."
 
 F30_rangers_armies_title:0 "Rangers Armies"
 F30_rangers_armies_desc:0 "The mercenary Sahiru have been an integral part of our military ever since our fight for independence. While they might in principle be hirelings, they have served Kumarkand exclusively for several decades now and have learned to operate in lockstep with our regular troops. This is an advantage we would be foolish to give up. It is long overdue to formalise this relationship and bind them even closer to our state. We shall create entire armies manned with our Rangers and bound to service the glory of Kumarkand with ironclad contracts."
 
 F30_back_bahar_title:0 "Back to Bahar"
 F30_back_bahar_desc:0 "Our realm stretches now from the source of the Suran to the westernmost tip of Bahar, from the mountains of the sun to the northernmost Harpy valley. Truly all of Surakels Garden is now part of Karqašlu. The western Bahari have by now accepted their new role as subjects of our magnanimous Akalunakal, even though some of their functionaries seem to leave confused after an audience and have been overheard to discuss amongst themselves whether some of the towns the Akalunakal talked about have not been buried by the sea since the great flood. The Bahari have turned their considerable efforts towards improving their homelands and endeavour to turn them into shining jewels in the Akalunakals crown to rival even the flourishing heartland."
 
 F30_calling_deep_title:0 "Calling the Deep"
 F30_calling_deep_desc:0 "A wise ruler does not wait for the enemy to carry out their plans but instead meets them on his own terms.” \n\n This at least is the reasoning heard from palace officials when asked about the purpose for the defence fortifications both mundane and magical erected all along the shore of the Divenhal. Who exactly that enemy is supposed to be is however not explained. Coincidentally many of the most promising mages of the empire have sequestered themselves with the Akalunakal to prepare for some great working, but what exactly the intent behind this ritual of immense proportions is remains to be seen. All along the shores of our empire a chilling sense of unease begins to grip the inhabitants of our coastal towns and villages."
 
 F30_tranquil_shores_title:0 "Tranquil Shores"
 F30_tranquil_shores_desc:0 "The idea is initially met with disbelief by many but it seems increasingly likely that the crest of the rogue wave has broken and Karqašlu is still left standing. The seemingly unending onslaught on our shores appears to have stopped after the final overwhelming rush of nightmarish creatures from the depths. Many have paid the ultimate price but it seems that this time around the Deep Devils have failed in extinguishing the light along Bulwars shores. The whole country awaits a proclamation from the palace with bated breath whether we should prepare for another desperate effort to hold back the forces of darkness or whether the Second Onslaught is finally over and it is time to mourn our losses and celebrate the victory of light."

 F30_younger_brother_title:0 "The Younger Brother"
 F30_younger_brother_desc:0 "Just like our distant ancestors the Qašnitu, who founded the mighty Karqašlu empire, were born from the union of ancient Bulwari and the nomadic Gigiru entering Surakels Garden from the distant lands beyond the Serpentspine, so are the Akalšesi of today the heirs of both sedentary Bulwari Nazites and Akalite nomads and therefore our younger brothers. We do not only share a glorious past but also a current inglorious fate as subservient vassals of the Varamhari. Let us appeal to our brethren in Arašbar to rise up with us to strike against our oppressors and reclaim our rightful place."
 
 F30_just_cause_title:0 "Cause Juste"
 F30_just_cause_desc:0 "All our hard efforts, our constant vigilance and cunning subterfuge has finally paid of - we are not only ready to strike at a moment's notice but thanks to a stroke of luck one of our agents in the court of Varamhar has provided us with a remarkable piece of intelligence. It appears as if the highest echelons of Varamhari administration including Kalodir himself, have been involved in a blasphemous endeavour of breathtaking scope. Their heretical so-called ‘Project Divinity’ appears to be an attempt to employ dangerous magics to turn a mortal into some sort of false god. If we were to propagate news of this discovery to our neighbours and use it as a pretext for our rebellion, even other elven realms would be disinclined to come to the aid of our overlord. The time to strike is now!"
 
 F30_kumarkandi_dawn_title:0 "Kumarkandi Dawn"
 F30_kumarkandi_dawn_desc:0 "It is done! We have struck down the conceited Varamhari who thought to keep us in chains, us, the heirs of Karqašlu and rightful rulers of Bulwar! They shall be forced to recognize the enormity of their error and repent! A new dawn has risen over Kumarkand and just as Surakels light burns away all darkness, so will we become a shining beacon of light and eventually restore the proper order of things in all of Bulwar."
 
 F30_honouring_word_title:0 "Honouring our Word"
 F30_honouring_word_desc:0 "Just as Akalšes stood by us in our hour of need and helped to throw off the yoke of Varamhari tyranny, so shall we help our Younger Brother in regaining their rightful lands around lake Naza. Let no one say that Kumarkand does not honour its promises."
 
 F30_zanites_again_title:0 "Zanites Together Again"
 F30_zanites_again_desc:0 "Along the middle Suran and the Buranun from lake Naza to the border of the lowlands along the gulf of glass lies the heartland of Bulwar. And the culture and traditions of its people, the Zanites, are not only the epitome of Bulwari high civilization but it is also the culture of empires. Both Karqašlu and Akalšes were founded by the ancestors of the Zanites. And now we have taken up the mantle and united all Zanites under our benevolent rule. The stronghold of civilization is united once more and ready to serve as the beating heart of a new empire!"
 
 F30_suran_flames_title:0 "Suran in Flames"
 F30_suran_flames_desc:0 "After those treacherous Akalšesi have been wiped from the map and the intractable priests of Eduz-Vacyn have been shown the error of their ways it is now time to bring the most distant part of Surakels Garden into our fold. The uppermost Suran and the Fortress of the Sun, Azka-Sur, with its renowned Confluence Temple, Eduz-Meduru, beckon. Let us raise the flag of Kumarkand over the easternmost great Temple along the Suran!"
 
 F30_empire_edge_title:0 "Empire's Edge"
 F30_empire_edge_desc:0 "We have reached the outer limits of Bulwari civilization. Beyond here lies only a scorching wasteland filled with malevolent gnolls, shrieking harpies and ferocious tribesmen unworthy of our attention. It is now our duty to protect the inhabitants of our newly gained lands and to return their war torn lands into the fecund garden it is supposed to be. And, just like our ancestors did, we will of course have to make sure that the dwarves of the mountains know their place and do not attempt to meddle in our affairs, like they were accustomed to with the pliable weaklings on the throne of Azka-Sur who allowed an undue influence from beneath the mountain."
 
 F30_regigning_ituqattar_title:0 "Reigning in the Ituqattar"
 F30_regigning_ituqattar_desc:0 "While nobody can doubt the pivotal role our valiant Ituqattar have played in the expansion of our empire's borders, this has led to a pervasive hubris amongst their ranks. Some whisper that they see themselves not as loyal servants of our Akal as willed by Surakel, but as the true power behind Kumarkands rise. There are murmurings in the corridors of the palace that our Akal is displeased with their demonstrations of independence both on and off the battlefield. It seems a reckoning is in order to remind the Ituqattar of their proper place in the ordained order."
 
 F30_crowning_empire_title:0 "Crowning a Empire"
 F30_crowning_empire_desc:0 "The astonishing rise of Kumarkand from backwater vassal state to undisputed hegemon of all of Bulwar has convinced many that this was the will of Surakel at work, His hand guiding the Akal in his quest to return order to Surakels Garden. But with the conquests resulting from the military and diplomatic successes of the recent past new challenges have arisen. Kumarkand is no longer one petty Akalate of many, but an empire in all but name. And at its heart, every empire is the manifestation of an idea that is strong enough to bind its many disparate parts and their diverse denizens together. Not only the Karqašlu enthusiasts of the Qašnitu Revivalist Society have enthusiastically embraced the idea that donning the mantle of ancient Karqašlu is precisely what is needed to legitimise our rule. The decision how to proceed into the future now lies with our esteemed Akal."
 
 F30_conquerors_legion_title:0 "A Conqueror's Legion"
 F30_conquerors_legion_desc:0 "Strong, tenacious, resourceful - the Kumarkandi Rangers are idols for many of the sons and daughters of Karqašlu. While in theory their corps is separate from the regular army of the empire, in the mind of many they are just as much a part of Karqašlu and integral for many of its successes in the past. It is long overdue to dispense with the fiction that they are mere mercenaries and acknowledge the role they play in the inner workings of the imperial military. Let us inaugurate an imperial Sahiru Legion, a Legion for our Akalunakal composed of the most promising rangers, ready to enforce his will on all our enemies."
 
 F30_first_greatest_title:0 "First and Greatest"
 F30_first_greatest_desc:0 "Karqašlu, just like Sarnagir, the sun's winged herald, or the sun itself, is a physical manifestation of Surakels Will. The sun may set for a while and the world is plunged in darkness, but there is always, always a glorious new dawn! Ours is the first and greatest empire the many lands of Bulwar have known. And while many generations may have toiled after the first Karqašlu fell to the abominable forces of the Malevolent Dark during the Onslaught,  their suffering was not for naught. Surakels Garden is once again in the hands of its rightful Custodian. And this time we have proven ourselves more than a match for the forces of darkness from the depths as well as arrogant false god kings leading their followers astray while lazing around in luxury. Surakels will is revealed through the enlightened orders of our beloved Akalunakal and we shall strive tirelessly to ensure that this time the sun never sets on Karqašlu!"
 
 F30_balance_checks_title:0 "Balance Checks"
 F30_balance_checks_desc:0 "While our lands are prosperous, too much of our wealth flows directly into the treasury of our Varamhari overlords. If we ever want to become masters of our own destiny again, we need to redirect these treasures into our own coffers. With clever administrators that do not shy away from some creative accounting and the support of local merchants willing to bear a heavier tax burden for a noble cause we will find a much better use for the riches of our lands and hopefully leave our temporary masters none the wiser."
 
 F30_bulwari_business_title:0 "Bulwari Business"
 F30_bulwari_business_desc:0 "If there is one thing that can be relied upon in the evershifting quicksand of shifting alliances that characterise Bulwari politics ever since the fall of the Phoenix empire, it is the unflinching sense for business opportunities amongst the Council of Twelve Families that rule the venerable metropolis of Bulwar. Let us approach these Barkabti magnates with an irresistible offer. A substantial contribution to the rebuilding efforts necessary after the plunder of the city by the gnollish hordes of Tluukt in return for their one-off military support when our uprising begins."
 
 F30_tactics_rebellion_title:0 "Tactics of Rebellion"
 F30_tactics_rebellion_desc:0 "While we would like to claim to be the first amongst the Bulwari to shake off the shackles of elven rule, another has beat us in this regard. Dartaxes rose up during the Decades of Devastation in Bahar and has defended his lands against any elven attempts to subdue him and his followers ever since. We might be well advised to try to learn their tactics and glean their secrets in order to help our coming insurrection."
 
 F30_break_soil_title:0 "Break the Soil"
 F30_break_soil_desc:0 "Mother Buranun always blessed the lands of Kumarkand with fertile soil and rich harvests. Our people have thrived on the lush shores of the river and grown in number. Now that we have finally removed the last traces of devastation caused by the disastrous campaigns of our former Varamhari overlords against the harpies, we can focus again on improving our lands and planting new fields. Some say that beneath some of the hills along the river banks lie the remains of ancient settlements, much like the ruins of fabled Panu Karqašlu near our capital. Who knows what we will discover once we level them to make room for new fields?"
 
 F30_finest_host_title:0 "Finest of Hosts"
 F30_finest_host_desc:0 "Our gracious Akal had the inspired idea to turn our peoples traditional skill with horse riding into a strong military advantage against any opponent by creating an elite charioteer force. To honour our venerated ancestors this host will be called Ituqattar like the legendary charioteers of old that crushed any foe foolish enough to stand against the might of the Karqašlu empire. And just like these warriors of old our new Ituqattar will be the fist that breaks anyone who stands against us."
 
 F30_honest_work_title:0 "Honest Work"
 F30_honest_work_desc:0 "Our peasants are hardworking, diligent and knowledgeable in the temperamental ways of Mother Buranun and the turning of the seasons. But as the wise men say there is always room for improvement. The halflings found in the lands on the far western edge of the world have a well-deserved reputation as prodigious farmers that could turn even a desert into a blooming garden. Our records from the time of the Jexisian empire tell tales of mutually beneficial dealings between our troops stationed in the west and these halflings. Let us invite some of these Moonfoot halflings to our lands to become Sunfoots and help increase our harvests to feed the people of our growing empire."
 
 F30_bulwari_sundriders_title:0 "Bulwari Sunriders"
 F30_bulwari_sundriders_desc:0 "Ever since we convinced them to follow us and reclaim their former glory, our elven Sarraka forces have proven to be an invaluable asset for our armies without whom many battles might have turned out quite differently. But with our borders expanding in all directions it becomes more and more apparent that they cannot be everywhere at once. Those original members that remain are increasingly stretched beyond their limits, serving as the sorcerous cavalry vanguard of our armies as well as bodyguards for our Akal and important members of the court. Given that only so many new elven recruits leave Ulmiš Idiqlat every year to replace those sunriders who have fallen or retired, it is clear to even the staunchest traditionalist that things have to change. The former mage prison in Azkabar has therefore been chosen as the site of the new Sarraka headquarters and the ranks of the sunriders have been opened up to human mages willing to serve, returning the Sarraka to their origins. Even some former inmates of Azkabar, who were wrongfully imprisoned simply for showing a talent for magic as a human, have already joined their ranks."
 
 F30_kasnitu_society_title:0 "Qašnitu Revivalist Society"
 F30_kasnitu_society_desc:0 "While our people have always been proud of our exalted past, the unprecedented successes of the recent past have sparked a more fervent passion for the lives of our Qašnitu ancestors in some members of our cultural elite. The most zealous admirers of ancient Karqašlu and all its glories have joined together to form the Qašnitu Revivalist Society with the purpose of unearthing the wisdom of our ancestors and returning modern Kumarkandi society to the heights of civilization enjoyed in antiquity. Their spokesmen have proposed to build a hall of learning to study all aspects of our illustrious past and apply the lessons learned to improve our present"
 
 F30_farming_act_title:0 "Kumarkandi Farming Act"
 F30_farming_act_desc:0 "It is by the grace of our glorious Akal that even the lowest of peasants is not forgotten in Kumarkand. A massive program of dike construction, building of intricate irrigation networks, reclamation of barren fields and the accompanying infrastructure from bridges and roads to mills and grain silos has been undertaken under orders from the palace. And the effort surely has paid off. Our already fertile lands are now almost overflowing with crops and teeming with livestock. Small bedraggled villages are prospering again and peasantry as well as cityfolk are well fed. All thanks to our wise Akal and his farming act!"
 
 F30_project_mortality_title:0 "Project Mortality"
 F30_project_mortality_desc:0 "The helmets found in the ruins of Panu Karqašlu confer some kind of immunity against magic. Aside from being a fascinating find that has kept our mages busy with theorising in the last decades, the decidedly practical applications of this have not gone unnoticed. It is the express desire of our Akal to restore as many of the helmets as possible and if necessary recreate them to outfit an entire army. This requires a heroic effort by our scholars and mages, as well as brave volunteers who will test out the new helmets and help work out possible design flaws in the unlikely event they should occur."
 
 F30_emperors_vengeance_title:0 "Emperor's Vengeance"
 F30_emperors_vengeance_desc:0 "All across Karqašlu barracks are bustling with new recruits, armouries are restocked, food stores are filled to the brim, marching roads are inspected and the imperial treasury is groaning under the strain of military expenditure. The signs are unmistakable - the empire prepares to march to war! The question on everyone's mind however is who is the target of the Akalunakals ire? Is it the gnollish slavers across the desert, the rich princes of Rahen, the western lands across the Divenhal or even the ferocious centaur hordes north of the Serpentspine who squat in the ancestral homeland of the Gigiru who founded the first Karqašlu empire? Those with well-placed connections in the imperial palace however receive disturbing reports of increasingly manic rants of the Akalunakal against the insular inhabitants of Kheterata and their indolent catlike overlords. Whatever they have done to enrage Alušir must be very grave indeed to warrant such an obsessive craving for vengeance, but not even the inner circle of his advisors seem to have a clear idea what offence precisely was committed."
 
 F30_elikhets_nightmare_title:0 "Elikhet's Nightmare"
 F30_elikhets_nightmare_desc:0 "It is done, timeworn Kheterata is no more, Elikhet’s spawn are left without their sycophantic servants, and all Elikhet’s works have been turned into dust! Alušir has been in a celebratory mood for a while now and has been observed to suffer paroxysms of laughter whenever the topic of our new Kheteratan holdings is brought up. Instead of shrines to self-absorbed khets who are only focused on their own pleasures and indifferent to the fate of their followers, newly erected temples to Surakel now adorn the shore of the Mother’s Sorrow and after millenia of being misled by Elikhet the Deceiver the people of Kheterata have started to rejoin their Bulwari brethren in the worship of Surakel. Of course there are still obstinate holdouts who still prescribe to the old ways but they, too, will learn that a new age has dawned and the Stewardship of the Sorrow is a thing of the past. Whether they do so out of their own volition or with some gentle or not so gentle persuasion remains to be seen."
 
 F30_triumphs_empire_title:0 "Triumphs of Empire"
 F30_triumphs_empire_desc:0 "It is the prerogative of empires of all ages to take the finest accomplishments that subjugated lands have created as an offering and use it to enrich the imperial heartlands and we shall do no less. The Mother’s Sorrow is renowned across Halann as an unrivalled breadbasket capable of feeding countless hungry mouths. The agricultural techniques honed over the millennia might translate very well and allow us to tease even more crops from the fertile soil along the banks of Suran and Buranun. Another Kheteratan tradition that might be worth preserving is their uncanny ability to remake foreigners arriving on their shores, be they invaders or refugees, in their image. Let us open our arms to deserving strangers desiring to start anew, be they human, harpy, halfling, elf or dwarf - and maybe even gnolls, goblins and orcs. Let them weave themselves in the rich, multihued and shining silk tapestry that is Bulwari society and begin their existence anew bathed in Surakels benevolent light."
 
 F30_rangers_call_title:0 "Rangers On Call"
 F30_rangers_call_desc:0 "North of the river valley of Mother Buranun lie vast stretches of grassy plains gently rising up to the Harpy Hills that have been used for cattle farming since ancient times. These open lands have given rise to a peculiar type of herdsman, the Kumarkandi Ranger or Sahiru. Not only are they undisputed experts of cattle herding and traversing the remote hinterlands but they also guard their charges against predators both animal and sentient. This particular skill set has time and time again led to Sahirus taking up their wip, bow and blade and dealing with more obscure threats plaguing local villagers. We would be well advised to endear ourselves to this hard-bitten lot so that in turn we may avail ourselves to their services when needed."

Let us try to recruit just such an individual by making discreet inquiries amongst the dwarven traders from neighbouring dwarven holds that are visiting our markets."
 
 F30_policy_faith_title:0 "Policy on Faith"
 F30_policy_faith_desc:0 "One of the consequences of our newly gained independence is that we are no longer bound to blindly follow the lead of Varamhar in matters of faith. In the halls of our sun temples and beyond a spirited debate is raging on whether we should stay faithful to the tenets of the sun cult as established by the council of Brasan or if we should follow the example of the Desert Legion or Dartaxâgerdim and renounce orthodoxy for a new or maybe rather an old way of worshipping Surakel. Whatever we decide on in the end, the decision must be made, and soon, before sectarian unrest disrupts our hard-won peace and threatens all the progress we have managed to achieve in the last years."
 
 F30_faith_flux_title:0 "Faith in Flux"
 F30_faith_flux_desc:0 "The decision has been made, our road forward under the benevolent light of Surakel is clear to us once more. Now all that remains is to ensure that all our subjects join us on this road we have chosen. Let us send out the priests from their temples to remind everyone of Surakels grace. Kumarkand is changing and growing and the ways of our faith need to as well to keep up with the changing times."
 
 F30_benefactor_pious_title:0 "Benefactor for the Pious"
 F30_benefactor_pious_desc:0 "In fulfilling our destiny as caretakers of Surakels Garden our armies have expanded our realm to include many of the most venerable temples in all of Bulwar. It is therefore our duty as protector of the faithful and benefactor of the pious to ensure that all our subjects remain devoted to Surakel and the temples receive all the donations they require to continue their righteous work. That the priesthood in turn might be favourably inclined to announce to their parish that our Akal is blessed by Surakel and Kumarkand is guided by his will is an incidental but welcome benefit."
 
 F30_dimuzi_title:0 "Dimuzi Karqašlu’s Hero"
 F30_dimuzi_desc:0 "Dimuzi Gumar, the Chosen, or Dimuzi Behdarim, the Half-Immortal, son of a goddess and a royal prince of old Karqašlu, is one of the most venerated heroes of antiquity that to this day is known to every child on the streets of Apaškumar and beyond. It was he who, himself mortally wounded, slew the fallen goddess Nikšaru, mother of all harpies. After battling the forces of darkness for many years clad in the legendary armour granted to him by his divine mother, he gathered a group of legendary heroes to end the depredations of Nikšaru once and for all. \n\n Our sages have come to the conclusion that all clues point to Dimuzi being a Mišari, a half-elf, born of a human of royal Karqašlu blood and a precursor elven mother who chose to remain in Bulwar after the rest of her people left for their homelands in Aelantir. He has therefore become something of a patron hero for the Mišari in our lands who point to his heroic acts as proof that they as well have a purpose in Surakels Garden. \n\n Let us build a grand temple in his memory, where the faithful can pray to Surakel and aspire to be worthy of performing similar deeds in Surakels name. He truly was the ideal warrior hero serving his homeland and Surakels will, an exemplar and inspiration for us all!"
 
 F30_surakel_empire_title:0 "Surakel’s Chosen Empire"
 F30_surakel_empire_desc:0 "Even the most willfully obtuse observer will by now have to admit the rise of Kumarkand from subservient province to powerful empire is not due to mere happenstance. We are truly blessed by Surakel and the common people are keenly aware that our glorious Akal is guided by Surakels will and to disobey him is to refute Surakel’s light and turn to darkness. We are Surakel’s Chosen Empire and it is our sacred duty to guard His light against any and all incursions of the Malevolent Dark!"
 
 F30_riders_sun_title:0 "Riders of the Sun"
 F30_riders_sun_desc:0 "Nothing truly worthwhile comes without sacrifice. And not everyone is destined for greatness. But it is a sign of true devotion to Surakels cause to attempt the almost impossible and risk all in pursuit of a higher calling. \n\n The empire has expended considerable assets to ensure that our magicians will lack for nothing and be uniquely equipped to defend Karqašlu against all threats both within and without, no matter what magical tradition they subscribe to. To join the illustrious fellowship of the Sarraka has however become the aspiration of many a Bulwari with even the tiniest spark of magical talent. But only the most talented have what it takes to pass the harsh trials set before each aspirant before they can consider themselves a true Rider of the Sun. Many are left with nothing but broken dreams or not even their life. It is now time to hold a grand tournament to determine who is worthy of joining the ranks of the Sarraka and allow them to expand their ranks to an extent befitting the needs of our empire!"

In the north the wings of the ambitious Harpy matriarchs throw a looming shadow across the land while in the south the disturbing sound of Gnollish cackling can be heard along the southern banks of the Suran. And in both east and west the vainglorious elven petty kings, whose realms have risen from the ashes of the Phoenix Empire, seem increasingly eager to reignite the embers of the latest cinder war and waste their troops in another futile struggle for dominance. With Kumarkand sitting in between belligerent rivals and monstrous incursions striking ever deeper into the heart of Bulwar its ruler will have to take desperate measures to ensure that Kumarkand has a future and will not end up sacrificed on the altar of another king's ambition. \n\n Kumarkand however was not always merely the battleground for other empires. One must only step outside the city gates of modern Apaškumar to see the vast ruins of ancient Panu Karqašlu, the imperial capital of the legendary Karqašlu empire of old. With reports of unrest and turmoil in all corners of Bulwar being whispered on every street of Kumarkand, many are wondering if maybe now is the time to recall the illustrious past and strive for an even more glorious future?"

 incident_whisper_shadows_desc:0 "The time has come to shake off the yoke of those who consider themselves masters of Kumarkand. While in due time the fate of our country will be decided upon the battlefield, for now we will have to bide our time and build up our strength far from the prying eyes of our overlord. This is an occasion for strategic half-truths, lies of omission and subtle distractions to divert any and all unwanted attention until it is time to discard this ruse and act"
 
 #Privileges

 estate_church_surakels_orthodoxy:0 "Surakel's Orthodoxy"
 estate_church_surakels_orthodoxy_desc:0 "Turning our back on centuries of theological thought and rejecting the notion of elves as Surakel’s chosen might be not only the righteous decision but also a wise choice in the long run to ensure rapport amongst the faithful united under our glorious rule, whether they are elves, humans or harpies. But momentarily this drastic decision has sown turmoil amongst the faithful and has provoked a massive backlash from the more orthodox elements of the priesthood who disagree with the new direction we have envisioned for our faith."
 estate_adventurers_rangers:0 "Kumarkandi Rangers"
 estate_adventurers_rangers_desc:0 "The Sahiru are not mere rootless mercenaries or sellswords but possess a fierce loyalty to their homeland Kumarkand. It is only fitting that we reward such loyalty and grant our Rangers an appropriate role in our military and administration."

 #Decisions
 
 curb_orthodoxy_title:0 "Curb the Orthodoxy"
 curb_orthodoxy_desc:0 "It has been an arduous process but the cadre of court theologians and philosophers tasked with promoting the righteous way to worship Surakel and spreading our vision for the future of the Sun Cult have managed to successively sideline the orthodox hardliners of the old guard amongst the Kašras of the main temples and their followers. The heresies that dominated the Sun Cult for centuries have been marginalised and the faithful are increasingly receptive to follow the ways of their forefathers and more and more worship Surakel as he has been revered for centuries before the coming of Jaher"

The so-called Mandate of the Khet has no place in our realm - Surakel’s blessing is all we will ever need. This time we will finish what the lords of ancient Karqašlu attempted long ago and bring his light to the shores of the Mother’s Sorrow!"
