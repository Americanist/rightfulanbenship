    flavour_khugra.1.t:0 "War of Colours" 
    flavour_khugra.1.d:0 "The city of Khugra never knew independence, despite its strategically important location and long history. A major port within the Karasskas Empire, Khugra was one of the few cities that stayed loyal to Karassk during its collapse in the 8th century. In its rump state, plagued by turmoil and misfortune, Karassk eventually lost its ability to protect Khugra from external threats. When the Shagadyrra tribe besieged Khugra in 1389, Karassk did not answer the city's calls for help, leaving its people to their fate, and marking the start of Khugra’s history as an independent Ikatara.\n\nKhugra managed to negotiate peace with the tribe, accepting them as equals and employing them in the army. A few years later however, the ambitious Raktaya Teran of Nazhni blockaded the city, defeating their young fleet at sea. Khugra had to accept a humiliating peace agreement, selling entire districts of the city to Nazhnas traders.\n\nThe Shagadyrra tribes quickly integrated into Khugra's society. However, after Sykar Riverclaw defeated the Anzara empire and seized the city of Zerat, many tribesmen had shifted their loyalties, wishing to secede to Rayaz and enter the service of the chosen of the naga. Others prefer his brother Katyradz Riverclaw, who had recently taken the city of Ashuzal and is now in a bid to defeat the dying Karassk. If he succeeds in his mission, many in Khugra would be willing to overthrow the state to join his cause.\n\nKhugra's problems are numerous, and for many in the nation, pledging loyalty to one of these powerful states may be the only way to keep the city and its people safe. Should we side with Rayaz, Asarta, or Nahzni? Or should we shun them all and stay independant against all the odds? Only time will tell if we will manage to keep control over the nation, or if Khugra’s independence will be as fleeting as a footprint on the shore, washed away by relentless tides."
    flavour_khugra.1.a:0 "The future of Khugra lays in one of these colours"
    war_of_colours_tt:0 "You have three privileges giving powerful negative modifiers, representing foreign influence in your country. To remove them, you can submit to one of your three powerful neighbors, but you will still keep the privilege associated with them and you will lose the provinces in your country claimed by the other two powers. Alternatively, you can try to overcome the challenges by fully destroying the enemies of Khugra."
    war_of_colours_other_tt:0 "We will receive a starting truce with Khugra, as the failing state waits for the outcome of the war between Asarta and Karassk. After that, the city state might submit to one of their powerful neighbors in exchange for support. If a power that is not us is chosen, we will seize any province in Khugra that we have a claim on."

One of the political factions inside their nation advocates for submission to us, and if they come out victorious from the power struggle Khugra’s allegiance to our state will be ensured. Even if another manages to snatch the sapphire city first, some of the bordering regions of Khugra belong to us by right, and we should be able to seize them as a compensation prize."
    flavour_khugra.2.a:0 "Wait and see"
    
    flavour_khugra.3.t:0 "Red Party Switches Allegiance"
    flavour_khugra.3.d:0 "Katyradz has failed, and the great city of Karassk remains firmly under the grip of the old kingdom. Our officials hoped that this would mean the desintegration of the Red Party, however they have been dissapointed, as the traitors have been quick to switch their allegiance away from the would-be-conquerors and towards the succesful defenders. They now advocate for our subjugation to our old overlord, who has largely usurped the role of Asarta in this War of Colours, changing a threat to our independence for another."

    flavour_khugra.4.t:0 "Khugra submits to us"
    flavour_khugra.4.d:0 "It seems like the party that advocated for submission to our nation has come out victorious from the internal power struggle in Khugra. Already they have sent diplomats requesting our protection in exchange for submission, an offer we are more than eager to accept. Some of their bordering regions have fallen under the control of the other powers involved in the struggle, but that is irrelevant now. Having established control over this rich port will be a great boon for our nation, and we did it without having to fire a single shot!"
    flavour_khugra.4.a:0 "About time they came into the fold"
    
    flavour_khugra.5.t:0 "Khugra submits to others"
    flavour_khugra.5.d:0 "Unfortunately it seems like the party that advocated for submission to our nation has been defeated during the power struggle in Khugra, and instead they have sworn allegiance to another of their neighbours. Many in our court are disappointed, but there is nothing we can do for now. If we want to seize Khugra in the future it will have to be through force of arms. However we have not come out of the War of Colours completely without reward, as our army has been able to seize the bordering lands we held claim over. We can only hope the people of Khugra soon come to sorely regret the mistake they made."
    flavour_khugra.5.a:0 "At least we got something from that deal"

    flavour_khugra.9.d:0 "We have successfully eliminated two of the three enemy parties, but now, the last remaining one has put all they have in a desperate last effort to destroy us and give the reins of power to their masters. They are supporting open rebellion against our rule, and seek to sabotage our armies to stop our imminent victory."

    flavour_khugra.13.d:0 "We have destroyed Asarta and Karassk, and the red party with them. Should we execute their main members for treason, or should we be merciful and offer a general amnesty? Among their ranks there are many talented generals, but perhaps it would be better for the nation to use this as an opportunity to ensure loyalty and professionalism in our military."

Among their ranks there are wise naga that could be an asset for the state, but perhaps it would be better to use this as an opportunity to stabilize the realm by replacing these traitors with truly loyal religious leaders."

    flavour_khugra.15.t:0 "Fate of the Golden Party"
    flavour_khugra.15.d:0 "We have destroyed Nazhni, and the gold party with them. Should we execute their main members for treason, or should we be merciful and offer a general amnesty? Among their ranks there are wealthy traders that could lend us their ships, and admirals that could be of service to our nation, but perhaps it would be better to confiscate their properties for their betrayal, and use those funds to rebuilt the nation."

Order is restored now in Khugra, and not only that, but after the struggle we have come to be one of the greatest powers in Taneyas!. It's now our time to rule, the Sapphire Party has triumphed, the other parties are dead, Khugra United, Khugra Eternal, Khugra free!"

We spend a lot, but it's all worth it, they are very happy. The Zurzis and the Thraxis are very cool too, but the ones we are closest with are the minor spirits of the wind and the waves. The fate of our nation is forever tied to this divine beings. We need to strengthen our bonds even further."

    flavour_khugra.18.d:0 "We have colonized the Dry Coast and met the Oono'i, they need help, they lack water, and they tell us they are tormented by an evil jungle who wants to enslave them. Thankfully we have come to save them from extinction! We will offer them evacuation towards Taneyas if they want it, they can serve our proud nation there! For the ones that stay, we will fight the evil jungle together, and make a big profit in the process. It's not like they have any choice but submitting to us."

    flavour_khugra.19.d:0 "The Taychendi seem to be engulfed in a chaotic age of constant war and strife. They also see us lizardfolk with great hostility, making cooperation almost impossible, and as such denying themselves the prosperity and richness that they would enjoy under our virtuous rule. This seems to be the largely result of their violent religion. As such, we have decided that we will forcefully enlighten them to the great benefits of serving Khugra, whether they want it or not."
    flavour_khugra.19.a:0 "We will forcefully teach them our virtuous ways"

    flavour_khugra.21.d:0 "Our ruler swims into the seas, under the shine of the Yusshela constellation, to request the blessing of the Celestial Dolphin. The powerful Araizary grants them a blessing, delivered by a sea animal made of star light. The beast swims around our ruler, eventually touching them and vanishing as they absorb its light.

    flavour_khugra.31.d:0 "Tragedy strikes! While following the Araizary towards unknown treasure, our sailors were attacked by a terrible sea monster! Neither the Araizary magic nor our ship weapons could deter the beast, and only one of our ships managed to get back to our shores."

    flavour_khugra.32.d:0 "After years of travel, the sailors of our great journey have come back! Unfortunately, it seems like the Araizary were unable to lead them to any location of interest. Perhaps the seas are just boring this season. We hope our sailors enjoyed the trip at least."

    flavour_khugra.33.t:0 "Great Journey - Mysterious Island"
    flavour_khugra.33.d:0 "After years of travel, the sailors of our great journey have come back! Or at least some of them. It seems like the Araizary led them to a previously uncharted island, which they explored, finding plentiful relics and treasures in the process. Eventually they came across a great mansion owned by a young and attractive lizardfolk woman, who invited them to dinner. The Araizary warned our men to not take her offer, but a good part of our expedition disobeyed them. This was a fatal mistake, as the woman was a vile witch who casted a spell on their food, turning them into tchokens! The rest of our sailors managed to escape, taking with them some of the found treasures. However, this is of little comfort for the mourning families of the tchokenified sailors."

    flavour_khugra.34.d:0 "After years of travel, the sailors of our great journey have come back! In fact, double the sailors have come back. In a bizarre turn of events, the Araizary have led our great journey to….another great journey. It seems like these lizardfolk embarked on a journey on their own around 20 years ago, and were just never driven back to their port by the Araizary, so they were kept lost in the seas, fed and supplied by the Araizary but unable to make it back to their homeland. This wasn't a malicious act by the Araizary, as after a brief talk with them we have come to realize the city they wished to return to was razed by hostile conquerors years ago, so they had no home to return. Now however they do have a place to return, a new home in the proud nation of Khugra!"
    flavour_khugra.34.a:0 "Our nation embraces them as long lost sons!"

    flavour_khugra.35.d:0 "We have waited for our sailors to come back for years, but they just….never did. Upon questioning our Araizary friends about their fate, they have informed us they are all safe and sound, but, “it is not their fate to return to Khugra”. No elaboration was offered besides this puzzling estatement, but at least we know they are not dead. Regardless, some of our people have accused our government of incompetence, claiming that the reason the Araizary dont want to return our men is that they believe they are better off in the seas than under a bad government."
    flavour_khugra.35.a:0 "So…no treasure?"

    flavour_khugra.36.t:0 "Great Journey - Ancient Magical Relic"
    flavour_khugra.36.d:0 "After years of travel, the sailors of our great journey have come back! The Araizary led them to a secluded island, which was hiding a magical relic of great power. It was, however, protected by a legion of magical constructs, surely left there by the wizard who previously owned it. With the help of the Araizary, our men dispatched these creatures with few casualties, and obtained the relic for our nation."

    flavour_khugra.38.d:0 "Food was scarce in some of our provinces, so the Araizary decided to lend us a hand by driving tons of fish and edible seaweed to our shores. Hundreds that were in risk of famine mere days ago are now feasting on more food they can possibly eat!"

    flavour_khugra.40.t:0 "Blessed Waves, Blessed Winds"
    flavour_khugra.40.d:0 "In an effort to reduce conflict and suffering in our coastal provinces, the Araizary have blessed the waves and the breeze of shores across our realm. Reports say these winds cure all physical ailments, while the winds calm the minds and induce happiness and bliss. This is making people much more cooperative with our government, as they see us as responsible for earning enough Araizary trust for them to grant us this blessing."
    flavour_khugra.40.a:0 "I need to try that breeze myself."

    flavour_khugra.41.t:0 "A Lizard from the Depths"
    flavour_khugra.41.d:0 "A strange lizardfolk, of huge size and covered in seaweed and barnacles, has emerged in Khugra. They claim the Araizary have asked them to offer their services to our nation. As a demonstration, they move their hands and the waves bend to their will. They are clearly a very powerful water planetouched."
    flavour_khugra.41.a:0 "They are clearly made for our navy"
    flavour_khugra.41.b:0 "They might struggle a bit in land, but I'm sure they will be a great general."

    flavour_khugra.42.t:0 "Magical Desalinization"
    flavour_khugra.42.d:0 "Seeing our fields struggle due to drought, our Araizary friends have used their power to take the salt out of sea water and send it to our lands. This water seems to be having a fertilizing effect, and fields are producing more than ever!"
    flavour_khugra.42.a:0 "Thank them profusely!"

    flavour_khugra.43.t:0 "Ancient Secrets Uncovered"
    flavour_khugra.43.d:0 "As a gesture of friendship, the Araizary have manipulated the winds and waves to uncover several ancient ruins and tablets containing forgotten information! This will be invaluable for our researchers."

    flavour_khugra.44.t:0 "Sage of the Waves"
    flavour_khugra.44.d:0 "A lizardfolk has come to our capital from the seas, walking above the waters as waves and winds paved a path for them. They claim to be a venerable sage and wizard that has lived for years in the sea among the Araizary and learned much from them. Now they have sent him to our court so they can serve our proud nation."

    flavour_khugra.46.d:0 "Festival of the Favoured Waves begins. Nobles, merchants, and common folk alike gather in a grand feast, a portion of their annual earnings offered to the holy waters in exchange for Yusshela's favour. In this manner, the tax is not a burden, but a celebration of faith and prosperity!"
