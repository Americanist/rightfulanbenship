 #Sibling's War Event Chain
 larankar_events.100.t: "The Heirs of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 larankar_events.100.d: "Tesheladar is earnest and a relatively skilled warrior, but he is prone to blunders and missteps, can be hot-headed and is generally not very prudential - many vassals favour him, though thats because they think they can master him. Narathya is as confident - some say arrogant - as she is innovative and well-read. She is also a better commander than her brother. Though she will undoubtedly be a better ruler, she is not widely supported as the warlords fear that she will implement reforms that will strengthen royal power, and disadvantage them. Though Narathya is older, many are pressuring the ruler to choose Tesheladar instead."
