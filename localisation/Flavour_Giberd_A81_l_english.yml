 flavor_giberd.1.t:0 "Aid From Giberd"
 flavor_giberd.1.d:0 "Recently, we have received a large amount of gold from our gnomish brethren in Giberd. They say that this is because they had heard rumours that we were planning to liberate the Dragon Coast from the kobolds, and wanted to assist us in our noble endeavour. This will greatly assist us in our efforts, and the assistance of the imperial gnomes will never be forgotten."
 flavor_giberd.1.a:0 "We will use this wisely."

 flavor_giberd.2.t:0 "A Gnomish Elector?"
 flavor_giberd.2.d:0 "The rising influence of gnomes in Esmaria has led them to demand an electorate, to make themselves equal to the other minorities within the empire. While this would grant us a powerful friend in Esmaria, this land was secured through conquest, setting a bad precedent for the future appointment of electors. If we refuse, however, there could be mass unrest, and we would certainly become the permanent enemies of this rising power of Esmaria. Should we elevate the principality of Giberd to the electorate of Giberd?"
 flavor_giberd.2.a:0 "Let us grant them equal stature with other minorities within the empire."
 flavor_giberd.2.b:0 "Don't we already have enough powerful short people?"

 flavor_giberd.3.d:0 "Today, glorious news has arrived in Giberd, and the whole land has erupted in celebration. The river parties have intensified, temple bells have been rung, and it seems everyone is in the streets. We have received congratulations both from the dwarves of Silverforge, as well as gnomish communities across the world, for today, our dreams were fulfilled.  The emperor has granted our request for a gnomish electorate, and we are now truly equal within the empire. Today truly is a great day for gnomekind. "
 flavor_giberd.3.a:0 "We may finally stand tall!"

 flavor_giberd.4.t:0 "Electorate Refused"
 flavor_giberd.4.d:0 "Today, dark news has arrived in Giberd, and the whole land is united in rage. The river parties have turned to riots, and it seems that the whole nation is in the streets. The dwarves of Silverforge have also sent condolences, and promise to support us in any course of action we take. The emperor has refused our requests for a gnomish electorate, keeping us from being truly equal within the empire. Today is truly a dark day for gnomekind, but we will take what we deserve, by force if necessary."

The Emperor in a move to undermine the magsteriums watch sends the delegation a letter late into the evening in secret asking that the gnomes propose that they will construct an aritifcery gift for the Emperor. One that will amaze all if only the Emperor would grant them Electorship, this would appease the Magisterium as an act of showing respect and the invention would please the emperor who is curious to see what we can come up with!"

Giberd is made to swear on the life of the emperor, the watch of the magisterium and the gods themselves that they shall faithfully serve the empire and its interests in their new role.\n\nFinally the augmentation and title "Electorate for the Representaiton of the Gnomish People" is bestowed upon Giberd and celebrations break out throughout Esmaria and on the rivers as mages relay information from the imperial.""

 flavor_giberd.17.a:0 "The team has done Giberd proud."

 flavor_giberd.18.t:0 "The Demands of the enclaves & Esmari"
 flavor_giberd.18.d:0 "A represensative of the Esmari and the gnomish enclaves of Esmaria both arrived upon the same day to our capital with the intent purpose of providing a list of concerns and needs that the Esmari people need fixed, it seems our willingness to use artificery to improve Giberd has provoked the idea in many Esmari's heads that technology could aid them greatly. Meanwhile the Gnomkish enclaves having secretly aided our conquests now have a list of resources they require so that they are able to finally be artificers with resources to match their ambitions."
