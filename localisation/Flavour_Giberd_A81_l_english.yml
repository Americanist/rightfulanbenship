 flavor_giberd.1.d:0 "Recently, we have received a large amount of gold from our gnomish brethren in Giberd. They say that this is because they had heard rumours that we were planning to liberate the Dragon Coast from the kobolds, and wanted to assist us in our noble endeavour.

 flavor_giberd.2.d:0 "The rising influence of gnomes in Esmaria has led them to demand an electorate, to make themselves equal to the other minorities within the empire. While this would grant us a powerful friend in Esmaria, this land was secured through conquest, setting a bad precedent for the future appointment of electors. If we refuse, however, there could be mass unrest, and we would certainly become the permanent enemies of this rising power of Esmaria. Should we elevate the principality of Giberd to the electorate of Giberd?"

The dwarves of Silverforge have also sent condolences, and promise to support us in any course of action we take. The emperor has refused our requests for a gnomish electorate, keeping us from being truly equal within the empire.
